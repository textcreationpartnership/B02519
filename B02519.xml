            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Introduction.</head>
            <p>ABout Five Hundred Years after the Death of our Bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, one <hi>Phocas</hi> (who had Murdered his Maſter <hi>Mauritius</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and his Children) firſt Advanced the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be Univerſal Biſhops and Heads of the Church; at which time they were endowed with theſe large Poſſeſſions and Donations which they call St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patrimony,</hi> and which they falſly aſſert to be the Gift of <hi>Conſtantine the Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> growing Great, Mighty, Rich and Proud, at once loſt its Humility and Purity of Religion, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Politick and Tyrannical Principles, which cauſed her Defiled Hands to lay aſide the Sword of the Spirit, and to make uſe of the Temporal Sword, which ſhe uſed to the Depoſing and Murthering of divers Kings, Princes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For after they had once taſted the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Wealth, Eaſe and Proſperity, the Popes began to ſwell in Pride and Pomp, and the
<pb facs="tcp:174108:6"/>more they Flouriſhed in this World, the more the Holy Spirit of God forſook them, ſo that in a ſhort time thoſe Biſhops who were Poor, Mean, Indigent, Perſecuted, and wanting all things, began to Triumph over <hi>Princes,</hi> to tread upon the Necks of <hi>Emperors,</hi> and to bring the Heads of Kings under their Uſurped Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They were carryed upon Mens Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in all manner of Magnificence, as if the Earth were not good enough to bear them; they were honoured as Gods on Earth; and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign <hi>Princes, Dukes</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> &amp;c. went bare headed before them. And not only ſo, but through their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> they grew ſo great Apoſtates from Chriſtians, that of being <hi>Perſecuted</hi> they became <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of others, and at laſt were ſo great Enemies to God and Religion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may now be juſtly Reckoned and Accounted the <hi>Antichriſt, or Man of Sin,</hi> ſo long before ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Pride and Inſolency of the Pope and his Clergy, appeared in ſeveral Inſtances which might be given of it, but out of the Multitude we ſhall only collect ſome few, to ſhew what Slavery and Bondage both Princes and People were formerly ſubject to, under this <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Yoke. About the Year 1158. <hi>Frederick, Emperor</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> Marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope hearing of it, went with his Clergy to meet him; as ſoon as the <hi>Emperor</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:174108:7"/>ſaw the <hi>Pope,</hi> he Allighted from his Horſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and held the Popes Stirrup while he Alighted alſo, but it ſeems he miſtook the Left Stirrup inſtead of the Right, at which the Pope ſeemed to be very much offended, which the Emperor obſerving, he ſmilingly told the Pope, <hi>That he deſired to be excuſed, ſince he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to hold Stirrups,</hi> with which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment the Pope ſeemed to be ſatisfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this there happened ſome difference between the Pope and the Emperor, whereupon the Pope curſed him, and ſends his Letters out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to all the Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> declaring, that he was an accurſed perſon, and ought to be avoided, and caſt out of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an company: He likewiſe ſtirred up his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Rebellion againſt him. The Emperor then marched to <hi>Rome</hi> to chaſtiſe his Pride, but the Popefled to <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> being required to ſend him to <hi>Frede ich,</hi> refuſed it; whereupon the Emperor ſent his Son <hi>Otho</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, with Men and Ships very well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but withal charged him by no means to attempt any thing againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> till he himſelf came: But the young man being full of heat and deſire of glory ventured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Enemy, and was by them overthrown, and himſelf taken Priſoner. Upon this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the compaſſionate Father, to releaſe his Son from captivity and miſery, was forced to ſubmit to whatever Conditions of Peace the
<pb facs="tcp:174108:7"/>Pope ſhould demand; whereby it was at laſt agreed, that the Emperour ſhould come into S. <hi>Marks</hi> Church at <hi>Venice,</hi> and there, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down at the Popes feet, he ſhould receive Abſolution and Forgiveneſs. This the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour perſormed; and the proud Pope ſetting his foot upon the Emperours Neck, ſaid that verſe in the Pſalm, <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon Lions and Adders; the young Lion and the Dragon ſhalt thou trample under foot;</hi> which the Pope applied to the Emperour; but the Emperour anſwered, <hi>Not to thee, but to</hi> Peter <hi>this power is given.</hi> The Pope replied, <hi>Both to me, and to Peter.</hi> The Emperour fearing further quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels durſt ſay no more, but was abſolved, and his Son was reſtored to his liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Not long after this, that is, in the time of that famous King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, one <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was by his extraordinary pride and inſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce the occaſion of very great diſturbance to the King and Kingdom: for the King c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lling his Nobles and the Clergy together, deſired that ſome Clergy-men might be called to anſwer for ſome Villanies by them committed; for it was proved that ſeveral perſons had been murdered by their means: This <hi>Thomas Besket</hi> would not conſent unto, without a Clauſe of ſeeing this Order; which very much diſpleaſed the King; but by the perſwaſion of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Becket</hi> afterward conſented; yet being
<pb facs="tcp:174108:8"/>incouraged by the Pope, he again fell off, and repented of what he had done, which the more inraged the King againſt him: This quarrel continued many years, and the King was ſo tormented by this proud Prelate, that he once paſſionately cryed out, <hi>Will no body a venge me of this Becket?</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken in the Hearing of ſome Gentlemen, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gueſſing at the Kings mind, four of them preſently went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and finding the Archbiſhop in the Cathedral, there they fell upon him, and kill'd him upon the Stairs of the Altar, every one ſtriking him over the head with his Sword, and then made their eſcape. This Murder was charged upon the King by the Popes Legate, and though the King ſwore that he was neither aiding nor conſenting to his death, yet he was forced to kiſs the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates Knee, and ſubmit to ſuch Penance as he ſhould appoint him; one part whereof was, that he ſhould abſolutely ſubmit to the Pope in all ſpiritual matters. And it is likewiſe recorded, that King <hi>Henry</hi> coming out of <hi>France,</hi> went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and as ſoon as he was in ſight of <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> Church, he got off his Horſe and pulling off his Shoes and Stockins, he went barefoot to <hi>Beckets</hi> Tomb, the ways being ſo ſharp and ſtony that his Feet bled as he paſſed along; and when he came there, every Monk in the Cloiſter whipt the Kings Back with a Rod; which ſhews (ſaith the Hiſtorian)
<pb facs="tcp:174108:8"/>what ſlavery Kings and Princes were at that time brought into, by the Popes Clergy. The ſame year the City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was almoſt burnt down, and <hi>Beckets</hi> Church was utterly conſumed. This <hi>Becket</hi> was afterward Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized for a Saint; but a Popiſh Hiſtorian ſaith of him, <hi>That he was worthy of death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for being ſo obſtainate againſt Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, his King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. King <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, was likewiſe made ſenſible of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of offending the Pope; for in the year 1205<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King being incenſed againſt the Clergy who poſſeſſed great Benefices, and yet neglected their Charge, he endeavoured to rectifie this and ſome other great miſcarriages about Electing Biſhops, and ſeveral other things: But the Pope fearing he would intrench upon his Privileges and Gain, ſtirred Heaven and Earth againſt him, Excommunicating and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, giving his Kingdom to the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſtirring up his own Nobility and people againſt him; ſo that the King being compaſſed about with Enemies on every ſide, was forced to ſubmit to the Pope, promiſing to do whatever he ſhould command him: Nay, the King took his Crown off his head, and kneeling upon his knees, in the midſt of all his Lords and Barons, he gave it to <hi>Pandulphus</hi> the Popes Legate, ſaying, <hi>Here I reſign up the Crown of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>to the hands of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:174108:9"/>Pope Innocent <hi>the Third, and lay my ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>y at his mercy and appointment. Pandulphus</hi> took the Crown from King <hi>John,</hi> and kept it five days; and the King giving then all his Kingdoms to the Pope, to be held in Farm from him and his Heirs for evermore, his Crown was reſtered again, King <hi>John</hi> engaging to pay ſeven hundred Marks a year for <hi>England,</hi> and three hundred for <hi>Ireland;</hi> half of it at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and half at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> as Rent for the ſald Kingdoms. This King <hi>John</hi> was afterward poyſoned by a Monk, which was judged ſuch a Meritorious Act, that the Murderer bad a Maſs appointed to be ſaid for his Soul for ever after, by his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Monks.</p>
            <p n="5">V Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the Third, ſtanding upon the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">VI. Nay to ſuch a height did the Popes at laſt arrive, that they governed all things: Emperors and Princes have been forced to kneel and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:174108:10"/>taken notice of, as diſſenting from many of the Common received Opinions of thoſe times, they were branded with all the odious Name of <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Twenty years after this one <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> was a famous Preacher among them, who taught them publickly a long time at <hi>Tholouſe</hi> in <hi>Savoy;</hi> in a ſhort time after they were grown to ſo great a multitude, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were reſolved, if poſſible, by any means to extirpate and deſtroy them; to which end, they at firſt incited ſeveral of the moſt Learned of their Party to write againſt them, and warned divers Princes to have a care of them, and to baniſh them out of their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
            <p>The firſt then that flung away the Spiritual Keys, and began valiantly to brandiſh the bloody Sword of Perſecution againſt them, was Pope <hi>Alexander the Third,</hi> who began there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to hack, hew, and murther the poor <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> ſo named from <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> or <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who appeared very cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious in oppoſing the many Corruptions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; as Holy Oyl, Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Images, Popes Indulgences, Candles, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Auricular Confeſſion, the Supremacy of the Pope, Falſe Miracles, Purgatory, Praying for the Dead, Prayers to Saints, extream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and many other Fopperies of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Communion: This Perſecution of <hi>Waldo</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:174108:10"/>his Followers (who were encreaſed to a very great number) began in <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1060. <hi>Waldo</hi> being compell'd to fly into the Mountains of <hi>France,</hi> among the Savage Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, to whom he taught his Doctrine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fled into <hi>Picardy,</hi> from whence they were called <hi>Picards,</hi> ſeveral into <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and thereby (for the ſafety of their Lives) they ſpread their Doctrine into all places.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being incited by the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> raiſed Arms againſt them, and deſtroyed Three Hundred Gentlemens Houſes and likewiſe ſeveral Walled Towns: And thoſe that fled into <hi>Flanders</hi> eſcaped little better, for they were purſued, and many of them for their Religion put to Death. And the Biſhops of <hi>Mayence</hi> and <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> raiſed great perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt thoſe which fled thither, there being Five and Thirty Citizens of <hi>Mayence</hi> burned in one Fire, and Eighteen in another, who ſuffered Death with very great conſtancy: and at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> at the inſtance of the Biſhop, Fourſcore were likewiſe burnt for profeſſing the ſame Truth, and yet by the exhortations, conſtancy, and patience of theſe Martyrs, there were ſuch multitudes who entertained their Doctrines, that in a few Years after in the County of <hi>Paſſau</hi> and in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> there were above Fourſcore thouſand perſons that made profeſſion of the ſame Faith. Some of them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:174108:11"/>likewiſe fled into <hi>England</hi> for ſhelter, but were more barbarouſly and cruelly put to death at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the Papiſts there, than ever any Chriſtians were before that time, for matters of Religion: and Three years after Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander the Third,</hi> made a Decree in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that theſe Goſpellers, and all their Favourers ſhould be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and that none of them ſhould buy or ſell, according as it was foretold in <hi>Revelat.</hi> 13.17.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Colen</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> Four Men, and Two young Women were diſcovered hid in a Barn, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> not being able to diſſwade them from the Truth, The Men were all tyed to the Stake to be burnt, but the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m: about this time a Proclamation was publiſhed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> whereby it was made Treaſon to relieve theſe poor Chriſtians, or to ſuffer them to live in that Country, and liberty was given to all people to abuſe them at pleaſure, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed for the ſame. But theſe people ſtill encreaſing, the Pope was reſolved to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them by all means poſſible, and therefore about the Year 1201. he ſet up the <hi>Bloody In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> which with its Racks, Tortures, Fire

Theſe Countries being ſo hot with the Fire of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many of theſe poor People fled into <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi> where they began to plant &amp; build Towns, as <hi>Saint Xiſt La Gard,</hi> and divers others, where they continued till the year, 1560. at which time they were moſt grievouſly perſecuted by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, and were forced to leave their Houſes and Habitations, and to fly into the Woods for the ſaving of their Lives, but being there purſued by order from the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> moſt of them were cruelly and barbarouſly murdered by the Souldiers, and ſome flying into fortified places, were ſo ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſieged, that they died with Famine: And at the ſame time one <hi>Charlin</hi> was rackt in ſo horrible a manner, that his Guts came out of his Belly: Another was tormented upon the Rack Eight hours together, to force him to confeſs what they pleaſed againſt himſelf and others, which yet he refuſed to do: Some were ſtript ſtark naked, and whipt to death with Rods of Iron, others were drawn through the Streets, and burnt with Firebrands, ſome thrown down from an High Tower, and ſome cut to pieces with ſharp Knives.

            <p>In the year 1620. in a Country called the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> or the <hi>Griſons</hi> Country, the Papiſts committed very great cruelties: thoſe poor people had for a long time enjoyed the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Religion; but about the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, when the Miniſter of a Town, called <hi>Tell,</hi> was preaching to his Congregation, the bloody Papiſts roſe in Arms and ſet upon them, beating and killing ſeveral of them: and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:174108:18"/>among the reſt, there was an Honourable Lady who was exhorted to change her Religion, if not for her own ſake, yet out of pity to her young Inſant that ſhe held in her Arms, which otherwiſe together with her ſelf, ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſlain: But the Lady with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage anſwered, <hi>I have not depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of</hi> Italy, <hi>my Native Country, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken all the Eſtate that I had there, to renounce the Faith of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt; No, I will ſuffer a thouſand deaths, if it be poſſible, rather than do it: And why in this caſe ſhould I have ſo much regard to my Infant, ſince God my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father ſpared not his own Son, my Lord Jeſus, but delivered him up to death in love to me, and ſuch ſinners as I am?</hi> And then giving her Child to one that ſtood by, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Behold, my Child; the Lord God, who hath care of the Birds of the Air, is much more able to ſave this poor creature, although it ſhould by you be left in theſe wild Mountains.</hi> Then unlacing her Gown, ſhe opened her Breaſt, ſaying. <hi>Here is the Body which you have power to kill; but my Soul, on which you have no power to lay your hands, that I commend to my God.</hi> And then theſe Blood-hounds preſently ſlew her and cut her to pieces: The Infant being a lovely ſweet Child they ſpared, and delivered to a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Nurſe to be brought up. Theſe Villains carried divers Women and Children to the tops of high Mountains, and if they would not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:174108:19"/>promiſe to go to Maſs, they were thrown down headlong, and torn to pieces.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Dominico Berto,</hi> a young man of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, becauſe he would not turn Papiſt, was ſet upon an Aſs, with his face to the Tail, and the Tail in his hand for a bridle, and with many ſcoffs and mocks was brought into the Market place: there they cut off his Noſe, Ears, and Checks, and then burnt many holes in divers parts of his body with hot Irons; and thus they barbarouſly continued to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him till he died.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe ſeized upon a Noble young Virgin, and carried her through the Streets with all imaginable diſgrace: They put a Miter of Paper upon her head, beſmeared her face with dirt, and buffetted her on the Cheeks with their Fiſts, and then bid her to call upon the Saints; but ſhe ſmiling ſaid, <hi>My truſt and my ſalvation is only in my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and upon him only will I reſt; as for the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>though ſhe be bleſſed above all women, yet ſhe is not Omniſcient, and therefore knows not our requeſts; yea, ſhe her ſelf hath need of the Merits of her own Son, without which ſhe could not have been ſaved.</hi> But they reviling and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing her, ſhe couragiouſly ſaid, <hi>I willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all this, as it becomes me to do, deſiring no better uſage, ſince the ſame was done to my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and to his Apoſtles, and to thouſands of the holy Martyrs.</hi> Upon this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174108:19"/>they carried her away and murder'd her in the Fields.</p>
            <p>In one houſe they ſlew a man and his Wife; and there being a little Girl in the Cradle of about three years old, of a very amiable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the poor Child ſeemed to ſmile upon them, whereupon one of theſe bloody Villains took her by the Heels and daſhed out her Brains. From thence theſe Wretches went to a Town called <hi>Bruſe,</hi> where they murthered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by ſhooting ſome, drowning others, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and grinding their very bones to powder. Amongſt others, they found an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Woman of fourſcore years old, whom they earneſtly perſwaded to hear Maſs, and that ſhe would reſpect her age; to whom with a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy reſolution ſhe anſwered, <hi>God forbid that I who now of a long time have had one foot in the Grave, ſhould forſake my Lord Jeſus. Chriſt, who hath ſo long preſerved me in the knowledge and profeſſion of his truth, and that I ſhould now put my truſt in Creatures and ſhould receive the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, inſtead of the holy Word of God.</hi> Upon theſe words they immediately ſlew her.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of the poor Proteſtants in <hi>Piedmont</hi> continued ſtill; they are under the Government of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and are the Off-ſpring of the old <hi>Waldenſes</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited there, and have ever ſince profeſſed the ſame Religion; they have Evangelical Churches
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174108:20"/>in the ſeveral Valleys of <hi>Angrognea, Bobio, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laro Valguicharda, Roras, Tagliacetto,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others; in all which moſt of their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are Proteſtants, and had been long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in their Religion by the Princes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> to whom they were Subjects: but in the year 1565. a cruel Edict was publiſhed, that all ſuch as would not comply with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and go to Maſs, ſhould within ten days be baniſhed from their Country, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; but by the Interceſſion of the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> this Edict was recalled, and they continued quiet till the year 1655. wherein that late hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Maſſacre was committed upon them for the ſake of their Religion.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts had all along by many cunning Plots and contrivances endeavoured their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, by uſing all Arts to ſtir them up to Rebellion, and by planting Jeſuits Colledges among them, which like Goads in their ſides ſtill annoyed them, and prov'd a great trouble and affliction to them; for they often procured ſome cruel and harſh Edict, or Proclamation, by their Complaints and Lyes which they raiſed in the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Court againſt them: As in the year 1602. they got an Edict for baniſhing all private and publick Proteſtant Schoolmaſters, as Enemies to the Government, and diſturbers of the Peace: and likewiſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Edict 1622. that no ſtrangers, either Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:174108:20"/>or others, ſhould be entertained among them. In 1634. an Edict came out, that all the Proteſtants of <hi>Compiglione</hi> ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and in 1654. the ſame was done againſt thoſe of <hi>Martino,</hi> and <hi>Peroſa.</hi> Theſe Miſſionary Fathers behaved themſelves among them more cruelly than <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But at laſt reſolving utterly to root out the Proteſtants from among them, and throughly to perform the will of their <hi>Unholy Father</hi> the Pope, they procured an Order in the midſt of Winter, that is, <hi>January</hi> 25. 1655. (which is very ſharp in thoſe Countries) for the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Proteſtants out of the Valleys of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna, Lucernetta,</hi> and ſeven other places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three days after publication, unleſs they would turn <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all in general, none being excepted, of what Rank, Degree, or Condition ſoever they were. And thus theſe poor Creatures were forced in compliance with this cruel Edict, to fly, for the ſecurity of their Lives and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in the depth of the Snow, and when all the Valleys were covered with water, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them ſome Women with-Child, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers newly delivered, young children crying and lamenting, old women, and decrepit men, leaning on their Staves, all dragged over the lce; through Rain, Snow, Waters, and a thouſand inconveniencies and hardſhips; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>This cruel Edict was put in execution by one <hi>Guſtaldo</hi> and others; but this was not all, the Deſign was for the utter extirpating and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Hereticks, as they called theſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, it would not ſatisfie them to have baniſhed theſe few, and the poor Proteſtants could have no redreſs at Court, for all their humble Petitions and Remonſtrances could not be heard.

            <p>Upon the ſeventeenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1655. whilſt the Proteſtant Deputies were detained at <hi>Turin,</hi> and delayed with hopes of redreſs, ſome Souldiers were ſent on purpoſe to fall unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly upon the Proteſtants, who peaceably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the iſſue of their Petitions, which cauſed ſome buſtle; for the poor people being promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Law of Nature ſtood upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the Papiſts loſt fifty men, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants only two. <hi>Wedneſday April</hi> 22.

            <p>There joyned immediately to this Army a great number of Out-laws, Priſoners, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Offenders, who thought to have ſaved their Souls, and filled their Purſes, by killing <hi>Heretioks:</hi> Six Regiments of <hi>French,</hi> beſides <hi>Iriſh,</hi> likewiſe helped them in this good work, the Country being promiſed to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Houſes flaming, Men, Women and Children Miſſacred and Murthered; nothing to be heard, but the confuſed cries of people flying, the piercing groans of others dying, and the horrid ſhrieks of others that were tormented: and indeed ſo dreadful was their uſage, that it is ſcarce to be expreſſed. In one place they moſt cruelly tormented an hundred and fifty Women and Children, and afterwards chopped off the Heads of ſome, and daſhed out the Brains of others againſt the Rocks; they took multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Priſoners, and ſuch of them who were fifteen years of Age and upwards, if they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go to Maſs, ſome of them were hanged up, others had their Feet nail'd to Trees, with their Heads hanging down, all which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly endured.

            <p>Other Women had their Breaſts, Noſes, Privities and Hands cut off, and ſo left to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh miſerably; another they ſtab'd in the ſoles of his feet, then cut off his Privities and fry'd them, giving them their Comrades to eat as a delicate Diſh; then they ſeared his Wounds with flaming Candles, cut off his Ears, and tore off his Nails with burning Pincers, to make him renounce his Religion; but he ſtill continuing conſtant, they tyed one of his Legs to a Mule, and ſo drag'd him about the Streets till he was almoſt dead: and after all this, they bound a Cord about his Head, and twiſted it with a Stick till his eyes and brains burſt out, and then caſt his body into a River.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Peter Simond</hi> of <hi>Angrogna</hi> they bound hand and foot, and then flung him down a dreadful Rock, or Precipice; but he happened in his fall to hang upon the ſtump of an old Tree, where he continued alive ſeveral days in a miſerable languiſhing condition before he died, not being able to help himſelf, and the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice being ſo high, that no other could come at him.</p>
            <p>They cut the body of an old man of ninety years of age into ſmall pieces, and then cut off

An old Woman had her Hands and Noſe cut off, and ſo was left alive. The body of another Woman was found in a Cave, with all the fleſh ſliced from the bones, and chopt like minced meat. Theſe bloody Papiſts took many little children, and tender Infants, and threw them down the ſteep Rocks, whereby they were daſhed to pieces.</p>
            <p>They took a Gentlemans Daughter, and put a long Stake in her body, and then carried her upon their ſhoulders, till at laſt being weary, they ſtruck the Stake into the ground, and ſo left her as a miſerable Spectacle. <hi>Andrea Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalin</hi> being taken Priſoner. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

They burned four Women of between eighty and ninety years old alive; they cut divers to pieces, and gave their fleſh to Dogs.

            <p>They ſtabbed ſome with impoyſoned Knives in the legs and feet, and ſo left them in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they died, One <hi>Gros,</hi> a Miniſters Son, being taken by them, they cut off his Fleſh in ſmall Gobbets while he was alive, and in the preſence of his Wife and Children, whom they murdered likewiſe before his eyes.

            <p>THe Perſecutions of the Papiſts againſt the <hi>Bohemians</hi> began very early, even about 977 years after the death of our bleſſed Saviour: Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Hell-brand</hi>) was the firſt that fell upon them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Pope <hi>Celeſtine;</hi> and Perſecution continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them for many years, and <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> were burnt in defence of the Goſpel at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> notwithſtanding they had the Publick Faith of the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> given them for their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>At a Town called <hi>Cuttenburgh</hi> there are many deep Metal Mines, into one of which, in the year 1420. the Papiſts threw one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

            <p>In the year 1421. one <hi>Pichel,</hi> a chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the City <hi>Litomeritia,</hi> having taken twenty four of the chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A while after a Miniſter, four men, and four Boys, were all burnt together in one fire at <hi>Prague,</hi> becauſe they received the Sacrament in both kinds: and indeed many and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable were the murthers, torments, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:174108:26"/>inhumane barbarities committed both publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and privately on theſe poor Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>About the year 1523. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhine as a great light in <hi>Germany,</hi> and his Doctrine ſoon overſpread <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and all the parts adjoyning; which ſo enraged the Pope and his Clergy that they continually raiſed very violent perſecutions againſt them, wherein multitudes of good Chriſtians loſt their lives by means of <hi>Ferdinand the Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Fift,</hi> Emperours of <hi>Germany.</hi> There were no leſs than two hundred Miniſters baniſhed out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> at one time, and the Lord of <hi>Schanow,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> was accuſed of a Conſpiracy, and laid upon the Rack; but he couragiouſly cut out his own Tongue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded the reaſon of it, he wrote, <hi>That it was, leſt the torments of the Rack ſhould make him ſpeak falſly againſt himſelf, or others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1617. <hi>Ferdinand the Second</hi> was obtruded upon the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who joining with the Papiſts raiſed up a very terrible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt the Proteſtants, which was the cauſe of the Electing of <hi>Frederick, Prince Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to be King of <hi>Bohemta,</hi> upon which there followed thoſe cruel Wars and troubles in that Country, wherein many godly Miniſters, and other pious, holy and good men, ſuffered ſuch barbarities and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manities from the Popiſh Souldiers, that the Ears of a Chriſtian cannot hear, nor his Tongue
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:174108:27"/>relate them, without the greateſt abhorrency and indignation: for ſome of them were ſtoned to death, others hanged upon a Beam, and with a ſoft fire made under them were roaſted to death, others were cut piece-meal: One Miniſter they laid on his back, and ramming his mouth full of Gunpowder, ſet fire to it, and blew his head all to pieces: Another they hanged up by the Privy Members, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years old, and burnt his own Books un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and at laſt ſhot him to death, after he had endured all manner of torment and pain.</p>
            <p>In the year 1621. all the Miniſters were baniſhed out of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and all the Provinces thereunto belonging, never more to return; and it was made death to harbour or conceal any of them. About the ſame time twenty one Miniſters were baniſhed from <hi>Cuttenburgh:</hi> A Popiſh Captain cauſed a Miniſters hand firſt to be ſtricken off, and then his head, his bowels to be taken out, and wrapt in his ſhirt, and his four quarters to be ſet upon four Stakes, and his head on another. At the ſame time likewiſe fifty of the Nobility were condemned, ſome to death, ſome to baniſhment, and others to perpetual impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; twenty ſeven were executed, who all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great conſtancy of mind, and fervency of ſpirit, ſealing the Proteſtant Cauſe with their blood, the heads and right hands of ſome of

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> ſtood up for the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and were taken Priſoners, in the year 1547. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Papiſts got the better, all ſorts of cruelties, murders, racks, tortures, fire and faggot followed upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo that all <hi>Germany</hi> was as it were in a flame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion at once, all places being in a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, ſome flying, and others ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death on every ſide for their Conſcience and Religion.</p>
            <p>At a Town called <hi>Meldorp,</hi> they took a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſter, named <hi>Sutphen</hi> out of his Bed, and forced him to go many miles on foot in Froſt and Snow upon the Ice, bare-footed and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legg'd, beating, cutting, and flaſhing him, and pricking him forward with their Halberts, and at laſt they barbarouſly roaſted him to death. Many were drowned at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and put to ſeveral ſorts of death.</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlewomen were yokt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Beaſts and ſo were turned out into the Woods, where they were raviſhed and abuſed, and then had their Hair and Ears cut off, and disfigured. In <hi>Pomeren</hi> they forced the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to eat their own Excrements, and if they refuſed them, they thruſt them down their Throats till they were choaked: They cram'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:174108:29"/>the ſecret parts of ſeveral women with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and ſo ſetting fire to it, moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly tore their Bellies and Wombs.</p>
            <p>Divers were hung up by the privy parts; they plained the faces of others with Chiſels; others they cauſed to draw on Boots filled with ſcalding Oyl, and ſo roaſted their legs over the fire: ſome men they gelt in the preſence of their wives and children: others had their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hung up by Cords, and by tying great weights to their limbs, all the joynts of their body were put out of joynt; ſome had Gags put in their mouths, and had ſtinking water and piſs poured down their Throats through a Tunnel, till their bellies ſwelled like a Tun, whereby they died in moſt cruel torment: They ſawed off the legs of ſome alive, and one Miniſter they bound upon a Table, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a great Cat upon his belly, ſo provoked the Cat, that ſhe ſcratcht his guts out of his belly withher Teeth and Nails, till he miſerably died.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Magdenburg</hi> they raviſhed the Wife and Daughter of a famous Miniſter before his face, and then violently ſnatcht a ſucking Infant from its Mothers breaſt, and ſtuck it on the top of a Lance; and when they had tormented his Eyes and Heart with theſe horrid Spectacles, they brought the Miniſter into the Street, and burnt him with his own Books.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſuch was their abominable filthineſs in <hi>Pomeren,</hi> that they raviſhed the faireſt Virgins
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:174108:29"/>before their Parents faces, forcing them to ſing Pſalms the while: one beautiful young woman they raviſhed, and then cut to pieces, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up her quarters in the Church: Girls of ten years old, and under, they raviſhed and abuſed, till they killed them; nay, ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous beaſtly were they, that they committed filthineſs with the dead Corps of thoſe women whom they had murdered. At <hi>Baſtl</hi> and <hi>Friburg</hi> they did the like, neither pitying old nor young men, women, nor innocent Babes, whom ſometimes they moſt barbarouſly uſed to eat, even when other meat might be had, yea ſuch inhumane cruelty they uſed, that in many places they left none remaining alive to relate the ſufferings of thoſe that were murdered.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe Maſſacres and bloody murders defiled the whole Land, and <hi>Germany</hi> groaned under the oppreſſion, till the peace of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnaburg</hi> in the year 1648. which put a ſtop to this cruel Perſecution, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> being compelled thereto, by Gods bringing in the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who over-ran <hi>Germany</hi> in a ſhort time, and thereby revived the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> which was almoſt over-born and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by ſo many thouſand violences and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, as it had lain under for many years.</p>
            <p>Theſe bloody Tyrants vented their rage and fury not only in <hi>Germany,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and other Countries, for they committed the ſame Villanies in all places where they had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:174108:30"/>power, the Miniſters were generally baniſhed, and put to death, and the ſame Picture of their cruelties which has been repreſented to you in <hi>Germany,</hi> was acted over again in this Kingdom, which we have not room to inſert, only a new ſort of death was invented there; they tyed Hens, Geeſe, Ducks and Hares to the naked Body of a worthy Miniſter in that Countrey, and then ſet the Dogs upon him, who tore and rent his Fleſh till he dyed.</p>
            <p>You have beheld many ſad and doleful Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, (and Reader, if thou art a Chriſtian, thy heart muſt almoſt bleed at the relation of them) we will therefore Epitomize the bloody cruelties of the Papiſts in POLAND.</p>
            <p>All the ſame things, or worſe, if it be poſſible, which we have related to be done in other places, were likewiſe acted in <hi>Poland;</hi> many thouſand Proteſtants, and good Chriſtians have been deſtroyed in that Kingdom, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at <hi>Karmin, Dumbuick, Shochy, Carienzin,</hi> and <hi>Leſna,</hi> all which Cities and Towns were deſtroyed and burnt to the ground for the cauſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Leſna</hi> was one of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and flouriſhing Cities in all the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> which was wholly laid in aſhes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three whole days in flames ere it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, in which there periſhed many hundred Proteſtants, beſides ineſtimable wealth and treaſure, no man reſiſting or oppoſing the fire.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:174108:30"/>Here they pulled off the Noſes of ſome, and put out the Eyes of others, and cut off the Tongues, Hands and Feet of divers, giving Quarter to none, but killing and deſtroying all that came in their way. They cut off the Hands of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matron of <hi>Leſna,</hi> and then murdered three of her Children before her Face, cutting off their Heads, and laying one at each Breaſt, and the other by her ſide. Another Woman hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Hands and Feet cut off, and her Tongue cut out, they ſowed up in a Sack, and ſo left her for two days in which ſhe lived, making a moſt miſerable lamentation.</p>
            <p>In the Lower <hi>Poland</hi> a multitude ſuffered, whole Families were butchered, and Men and Women, Young and Old, murdered without diſtinction. And in the year 1654. there was an horrible ſlaughter amongſt them, the Papiſts putting to death all the Proteſtants they could meet with by moſt exquiſite tortures: One Mr. <hi>Samuel Cardus,</hi> a Miniſter, they uſed with extream cruelties, firſt putting out his Eyes, and leading him about as a miſerable Spectacle; then they pull'd of his Fingers with Pincers, and poured melted Lead down his Throat, and while he was yet half alive, they put his Neck between two folding doors, and ſo violently ſevered his Head from his Body.</p>
            <p>They uſed the Miniſter of <hi>Dembnick,</hi> and another Miniſter, very barbarouſly; for after they had ſeveral ways tormented them, they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174108:31"/>cut their Throats with a Razor, and while they were breathing, flung them into a Pit, and covered them with filth and dung.</p>
            <p>The ſame Cruelties the barbarous and bloudy Papiſts acted againſt the Proteſtants in LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THUANIA, in the year 1648. ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering all that were not <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> without diſtinction of Age or Sex. Here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had their Skins flead off while they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, others their Hands and Feet cut off, ſome their Bowels taken out alive, others had their Shin-bones bored through; they poured melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lead into the wounds of ſome whom they had cut in the Head, and other parts of their Bodies: Some had their Eyes pulled out, and thoſe that were hanged up in all places were ſuch a multitude, that they are hard to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. It was counted a great mercy and kindneſs to be ſhot, beheaded, or killed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, without any other torment.</p>
            <p>The Wives and Daughters of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were every where raviſhed, their Houſes and Goods burnt and deſtroyed, and their Countrey, and their Churches laid waſte, ſo that there was nothing to be ſeen in every place but Murders and Maſſacres; and the Blood of the poor Suffering Proteſtants ran like Streams through the Streets of Towns and Cities, and thoſe that were left alive, and eſcaped the ſlaughter, were baniſhed their Countrey for ever.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:174108:31"/>
            <p>The Miniſters were chiefly aimed at, and always cruelly tormented. Among the reſt, one <hi>Adrian Chilmiskie</hi> (who was famous for his great Piety and Learning, and likewiſe for his Reverend Age) was by theſe Barbarous Wretches roaſted alive, and this they did lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely, with a few Chips and Straw, that he might be the longer in torment. In another place above forty ſuffered death by ſeveral-ſorts of tortures: Near <hi>Vilna,</hi> the chiefeſt City in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> one <hi>Smolskie,</hi> and his Son, both Miniſters, had their Heads cruelly ſawed off with a Sickle. Another Miniſter had his Fleſh ſliced off by piece-meal, till he died. And; to conclude this Field of Blood, there were no leſs than fifteen hundred poor Proteſtants, Miniſters as well as others, who were bound to Stakes on the Tops of Mountains in the Winter, and there miſerably ſtarved to death with hunger and cold. In a word, no Age nor Hiſtory can parallel all the ſeveral tortures and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deaths which theſe poor Proteſtants ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from the hands of bloody Papiſts, for no other Crime but profeſſing and aſſerting the Truth and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>One <hi>Stephen Brame,</hi> being condemned to be burned for the Conſtant Profeſſion of his Faith, when the Fire was kindled, a great wind drove away the Flame from him, ſo that he ſtood for an hours ſpace inſtructing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the People: They then brought Oyl Veſſels, and more Faggots, yet ſtill was the flame driven from him, whereupon the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtruck him on the head with a ſtaff, to whom he ſaid, <hi>I am condemned to be burned, and do you ſtrike me with Staves like a Dog?</hi> After which the Hangman run him through the Belly with a Pike, and then threw him into the Fire, and ſcattered his Aſhes in the Wind.</p>

            <p>In the year 1559, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond of <hi>France,</hi> there was one <hi>Ann du Bourg,</hi> a Noble man, and of admirable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, who when the King came one time into his Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> made a bold ſpeech before him, wherein he gave thanks to Almighty God for moving the Kings Heart, to be prefent at ſuch a weighty matter as that of Religion, (which it ſeems was then to be debated) humbly intreating him to conſider well thereof, it being the Cauſe of Chriſt himſelf, which of good Right ought to be maintained by Princes; but the King was ſo far from bearkening to him, that being in raged he commanded him to be committed to Priſon, and proteſted to him in theſe very words, <hi>Theſe Eyes of mine ſhall ſee thee burnt.</hi> And a while after he was condemned to die. In the mean time great Triumphs were preparing for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Kings Siſter &amp; Daughter, &amp; the day being come, he ſpent all the morning in Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters againſt <hi>Du Bourg,</hi> and ſome others

            <p>In the ſame City of <hi>Tours,</hi> there was a very Religious Woman, who being brought before the Captain, ſhe there gave an Account of her Faith, which ſhe confirmed by Scripture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Fryers who diſcourſed with her, could not return any anſwer, but only told her, <hi>That ſhe was in a damnable condition: It ſeems ſo indeed</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>being in your hands,</hi> And being then committed to priſon, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her mind freely, and comforted the other Proteſtant Priſoners; ſhe was afterward condemn'd to be hang'd, and the Rope being put about her neck, ſhe kneeled down, praiſing and magnifying the name of God in ſhewing her ſo much mercy, as by that death to deliver her out of this wretched world, and that ſhe was ſo far honoured as to die for the Truth, and to wear Gods Livery, as ſhe reckoned the halter to be; ſhe then brake her faſt with the reſt of the Company, and exhorted them to be of good courage and to truſt in the free mercy of God to the end. As ſhe went to Execution one of her kindred brought her own little Children to ſee her, and perſwaded her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and ſave her life, to provide for theſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Babes: This was a very great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wrought ſo upon her Motherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as drew plenty of Tears from her Eyes; But a while after reſuming her former Courage and Conſtancy, ſhe ſaid; <hi>I love my Children dearly, yet neither for love to them, nor for any

            <p>A while after the City of <hi>Roan</hi> was beſieged, and two of the Forts taken, wherein they put all the Proteſtants to the Sword, and the Queen Mother being at the Siege, ſhe led the young King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, who was then but twelve years old, to ſhew him the Naked Bodies of ſeveral poor Women, who weltred in their Blood; at laſt the City was taken, wherein all ſorts of monſtrous Cruelties were uſed, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring all they met with, and divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Souldiers were hanged, and the Sick and wounded were caſt into the River.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Valogues</hi> divers Perſons of good Quality were maſſacred, and among the reſt, a Godly Miniſter whoſe Body they ſtripped, and with many ſcoffs and ſcorns dragged it about the Houſe, and at laſt bringing it into a Room, where he uſed to preach, they kickt and ſpurn'd his Corps, ſaying, <hi>Now pray to God, and preach if thou canſt;</hi> the Popiſh Prieſts that were preſent, ſtuffed his Mouth and likewiſe his wounds with the Leaves of his Bible; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Above five hundred men were hanged upon Gibbets, among whom was a grave Counſellor in his long Gown and ſquare Cap.</p>
            <p>In the City of <hi>Blois</hi> the Murtherers hearing there was a Sermon, brake violently into the Houſe, thinking to have taken the Miniſter, but being diſappointed, they dragg'd ſeveral Women that were there, by the Hair of the Head, and beating them ſeverely, threw them into the River, but by the Providence of God, they had ſo much skill as to ſwim ſafely to an Iſland, but preſently after ſome Water-men finding them there, ſtript them ſtark naked, and threw them again into the River, yet ſtill they endeavoured to ſave themſelves, and ſwum toward the Suburbs of a Town called <hi>Vienne,</hi> and were there cruelly knocked on the Head by the bloody Papiſts. The <hi>French</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral having taken ſeveral Proteſtants Priſoners, he hanged moſt of them, but eſpecially the Miniſters; among the reſt there was a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, called <hi>La Mothe</hi> to whom the General gave divers ſtabs with a Dagger, and thruſt

            <p>Many horrible Murthers were likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the Proteſtants, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers one of their Practices was to throw them down from the top of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Abby, which was built upon an high Rock, under which there ran a deep and ſwift River, and by the way there was another Rock which ſtood far out, upon which their Bodies falling were daſht and torn to pieces: Among the reſt there was a young man, who ſeeing they were reſolved to murther him, requeſted that he might thus caſt himſelf from the top of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and if it pleaſed God to preſerve him in the fall, he might eſcape with Life; this they promiſed, whereupon having made his Prayers to God, he fetched a leap from the top of the Abby, and flew ſo far, that miſſing the Rocks under him, he fell into the River, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſwim out for his Life, but theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Villains knockt him on the Head, and killed him.</p>
            <p>A Captain and his Souldiers entring the Houſe of a Religious Widow, they bound her with Cords, and then put a Rope about her Neck, whereby ſhe was halled up and down, till ſhe was almoſt ſtrangled; they then asked h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:174108:42"/>Conſtancy, he anſwered, <hi>I am called ſo,</hi> and withal ſaid, <hi>Young man thou oughteſt to conſider my Age and the weak condition I am now in, but do what thou wilt, for thou canſt not ſhorten my life but a very little:</hi> But the Wretch blaſpheming God, thruſt him through the Breaſt, and afterward ſtrook him on the head; another ſhot him with a Piſtol, and a third wounded him in the Thigh; ſo that he lay gaſping for life; the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was below, and with a loud voice cryed, <hi>Have you done?</hi> It was anſwered, <hi>Yes;</hi> the Duke replyed, <hi>Our Chevalier</hi> (which was the Kings Baſtard Brother) <hi>will not believe it, unleſs he ſee it;</hi> which being done, his Face was all bloody, which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> wiping ſaid, <hi>Now I know it is he,</hi> and then kicked him on the Face with his Foot, whom all the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of <hi>France</hi> feared ſo much when he was alive.</p>
            <p>Then the Duke and his bloody Train went into the Streets, crying <hi>Arm, Arm, we have had good ſucceſs, and a happy beginning, Let us now proceed to the reſt, for it is the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> which words he repeated often, <hi>This is the Kings Commandment, this is his Will, this is his expreſs pleaſure, therefore courage, my Fellows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the great Bell of the Pallace which was the bloody token of the General Alarm, began to ring out aloud, and preſently a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was ſpread, That the Proteſtants had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:174108:43"/>conſpired againſt the King, Queen and Court, and were juſt going to Execute their Deſign; After this the Admirals head was cut off, and ſent to the King, and Queen Mother, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them preſerved with Spices, it was ſent to the Pope, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> as a very grateful preſent. The Pope when he firſt heard the News of the Maſſacre appointed a day of Publick Thankſgiving to God, where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung for joy in the Church of St. <hi>Lewis;</hi> He likewiſe Publiſhed a Bull of Pardons and extraordinary Indulgences to ſuch as ſhould pray for the Heavenly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the King and Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> for rooting out of Hereticks.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:174108:43"/>Women, and Children, Rich and Poor, crying for mercy to theſe bloody Hell-hounds, howling and lamenting at their miſerable Condition, to be thus wretchedly murdered for they knew not what: And all this interm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that in that night, and the Two next days there was ſlain in <hi>Paris</hi> above Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Perſons of both Sexes, and all Ranks and Ages, the bloody Papiſts not ſparing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Cradle, nor the Infants in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombs, inſomuch that the Streets, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and Rivers were dyed with Blood, and the Murtherers boaſted that they had in a few days put an end to that Quarrel, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pen, Paper, Decrees of Juſtice nor open War could accompliſh in Twelve years.</p>
            <p>This horrid M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſacre was committed on St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> day, being the 24 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1571. which was the Sabbath day, and is made ſamous for ever, by the Effuſion of ſo much precious Innocent blood, as no Age nor time can parallel, for there were at this time in <hi>Paris</hi> Threeſcore Thouſand men, with Piſtols, Poinards, Swords, Knives, and ſuch other Bloody Inſtruments, who ran up and down,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:174108:44"/>ſwearing and blaſpheming the Sacred Majeſty of God, cruelly maſſacring all they met; So that the Streets were covered with mangled Bodies, and the Gates and Doots defiled with blood, the Lords and Gentlemen were Inhumanely murdered, ſome in their Beds, others on the top of their Houſes, and in all other places where they were found, and ſuch a multitude of dead Bodies, were thrown into the River <hi>Sein,</hi> that the water was dyed Red with their Blood.</p>
            <p>In the Heiliſh Aſſembly wherein this bloody Maſſacre was concluded on, it was debated whether the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould not be deſtroyed with the reſt; the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tly with death and all manner of Torments, if they would not turn Papiſts;</hi> And thereupon the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be brought into his preſence, and told them, <hi>That now he had cut off all the Inſtruments of the late Civil Wars, which he hoped would prevent future troubles, for by his Command the Admiral was ſlain, and all the reſt of the Hereticks and that the like ſhould be Executed in all other places throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb facs="tcp:174108:44"/>and that if they would now ſave their Lives they muſt turn Catholicks, for he was reſolved to have but one Religion in his Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> humbly beſeeched his Majeſty to <hi>Remember his Oaths, Promiſes, and ſolemn Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations that they ſhould have the free Exerciſe of their Religion,</hi> and withal told the King, <hi>That he might do as he pleaſed with their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Eſtates, but their unſpotted Souls were in the hands of God; and that they were reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remain ſtedfaſt in their Religion, though with the loſs of their lives;</hi> which anſwer ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the King, that he called the Prince of <hi>Conde Rebel,</hi> and <hi>the Son of a Rebellious Perſon,</hi> horribly threatning him, <hi>That if within three days he did not obey his Command he ſhould die for it,</hi> and then with a furious Countenance left them with theſe three Terrible Words, <hi>Death, Maſs, or the</hi> Baſtile.</p>
            <p>Many Gentlemen that were attendants upon them, as likewiſe their Schoolmaſters and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, were thruſt out of the Chamber among the Murtherers, that is, among the Kings Guard of <hi>Switzers,</hi> who ſtood in two Ranks with their Swords drawn ready for Blood and Cruelty. Theſe Gentlemen crying out of the Kings Oaths, Promiſes and Fidelity, were yet by the Kings Command, and in his own Sight unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully hewen and cut in peices.</p>
            <p>In this Butcherly Maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> there
<pb facs="tcp:174108:45"/>were above four Thouſand Houſes robbed and plundered, and above Five Hundred Barons, Knights and Gentlemen, who were chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the War, with abundance of Noble young Gentlemen, Ladies, and Gentlewomen Inhumanely murthered, who little expected ſuch a bloody Fate, for they came from all parts to rejoyce, in honour of the marriage of the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and inſtead of Jollity and pleaſures, they here met with an untimely death, from Bloody and Cowardly Papiſts, who murther like Devils, but dare not fight like men.</p>
            <p>The King and his Conſidents ſearing that this Maſſacte would not end the Quarrel, but rather ſtir up the Proteſtants in other places to ſtand upon their own defence; He therefore ſends Meſſengers by Poſt to all parts of the Kingdom, often ſhifting Horſes for more ſpeed, with expreſs Commands to the Governours of all other Towns and Cities in <hi>France</hi> to follow the Example of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to deſtroy and kill all the Proteſtants which were amongſt them; and yet at the ſame time, the King writes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letters wherein he laid the fault of the murder of the Admiral, and the reſt upon the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as this Command was publiſhed, and that the Kings Letters came, the Papiſts fell with all imaginable fury upon all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants at <hi>Meaux, Troys, Orleans,</hi> and other
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:174108:45"/>places, murthering them without any manner of pity and Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>And among the reſt Monſieur <hi>De la Place,</hi> Preſident of the Court of Requeſts being in his houſe, a Captain came to him, and told him, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had killed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The poor Gentleman ſeeking ſhelter in three Houſes for his life, was denied, and was at laſt forced to return home again, where finding his wife ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorrowful, he rebuked her, and diſcourſt with her of the Promiſes of God, telling her, <hi>That through many Tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> and then calling his Family together, he made an Exhortation to them, went to prayer, and then read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Job,</hi> with <hi>Calvins</hi> Expoſition, and then praying again, he reſolved by Gods aſſiſtance to ſuffer all kind of Torments rather than to fly for it.</p>
            <p>Preſently after the <hi>Provoſt</hi> of the Merchants comes to his Houſe with many Archers, and an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:174108:46"/>Order to bring him to the King, and would not admit of any Excuſe, whereupon the Lord ſuppoſed what would happen, and therefore embracing his Wife, he deſired her never to forſake the truth of God; And ſo going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Palace, ſome Murtherers waited for him, and immediately ſtab'd him with their Daggers, ſo that he fell down d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad, and then ſtripping him, caſt his Body into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>After this, there followed the like Cruclties and Murders upon the Proteſtants in the Cities of <hi>Lyons, Tholouſe, Burdeau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet in the midſt of theſe dangers it pleaſed God to provide ſome places of refuge for them, as <hi>Rochel, Montalbon, Wiſmes, Saucerre, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> &amp;c. whither many Proteſtants fled from other places. In the year 1573. the Town of <hi>Saucerre</hi> was beſieged by the Lord of <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> who with his Cannon played inceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:174108:46"/>were ſhot thorough; The Siege being long, there was great ſcarcity, inſomuch that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were forced to eat Horſes, Aſſes, and Mules, which laſted a Month; afterwards they cat all the Dogs, Cats, Rats, Mice and Moles that they could get; and then they were forced to eat Parchments, Horſes, and Beaſts-Hoofs, Horns, Lanthorns, Haſters, Girdles of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Herbs, wild Roots and Furniture for Horſes, this being all ſpent, and no bread in the City, they made bread of <hi>Linſeed,</hi> Herbs mixt with Bran, Straw, Meal, Powder of Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells; yea Slates, Sewet, old Ointments, and other Greaſe ſerved to make Pottage; and therewith they likewiſe fryed the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſes and Men, which they eat, yea the very filth in the Streets was not ſpared.</p>
            <p>During this Extremity, a labourer and his wife were put to death for cating the Head, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails and Brains of their own Child, a Girl of three years old, who died with Famine, having likewiſe dreſſed the reſt of her body to eat at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. Thoſe that went out of the City Walls, were forced to live upon the Spriggs of Vines, Black-berries, Snails, and Herbs; and many of them were killed by the Enemy. And among other lamentable Spectacles, a poor man and his Wife were found dead among the Vines and two of their Children crying by them; the youngeſt being not above Six weeks old,

            <p>A Boy about five years old being famiſht for Hunger, running along the Streets, fell down for dead in the preſence of his Father and Mother, who wept over him, and felt his Arms and Legs, which were as dry as a Stick: To whom the Child ſaid, <hi>Why do you weep to ſee me die of hunger?

            <p>And that which preſerved the reſt from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing was, becauſe there were ſix Cows kept alive to give Milk to ſome few Intants, and ſome Horſes of ſervice reſerved for extremity were killed, and their fleſh ſold, and ſome little Corn was brought into the Town by ſtealth, which was ſold for half a Crown a pound.</p>
            <p>There died by the War but Eighty four
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:174108:47"/>Perſons, but the Famine deſtroyed Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the reſt were brought ſo low, that they hardly recovered. Divers voluntarily went out of the Town chuſing rather death than ſuch miſery, whereof ſome were ſlain, and others Impriſoned, and Executed.</p>
            <p>And now when all humane help failed, the King having ſworn, <hi>He would make them eat one another,</hi> and the Papiſts threatning to Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre them all; it pleaſed God ſtrangely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver theſe poor Proteſtants. For Ambaſſadors coming from <hi>Poland</hi> to fetch the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou</hi> the Kings Brother thither, whom they had choſen for their King; They having notice of this terrible ſiege, obtained by their Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that all the Towns in <hi>France</hi> which were moleſted for Religion ſhould have their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which means the poor <hi>Saucerreans</hi> half dead with hunger obtained their freedom, and were quietly ſuffered to depart with their Arms and Goods, and thoſe that would ſtay, not to be queſtioned for what was paſt.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time the Town of <hi>Rochel</hi> was likewiſe beſieged, the Townſmen often ſallying out, and divers hot skirmiſhes paſt; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt a young Gentleman boaſted with horrible blaſphemies, that he was one of the horrible Murderers of the Admiral, ſhewing his Sword, which he ſaid he brought from that exploit, to ſlaſh the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> but upon Tryal his heart failed him and he ran
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:174108:48"/>away, and one of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> purſuing him ſlew him, ſtript him, and left his body in the Field, and before next morning the dogs had torn his Face.</p>
            <p>In one Months ſpace the Papiſts diſcharged above Thirteen Thouſand Shot againſt the Town, and made many aſſaults, but always came off with loſs, The Siege continued two Months, and the Famine much increaſed upon them, but by Divine Providence, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proviſion failed them, there came a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſmall Fiſhes into the Haven, which were never ſeen there before, and was a very great relief to them, who continued during the ſiege, but preſently after the publiſhing the Edict of Peace, they went away and were never ſeen more. A while after the <hi>Rochellers</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe freed from the ſiege by means of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Ambaſſdors and enjoyed their former Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges: It is very remarkable that moſt of thoſe Perſons which were employed in the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris</hi> and other Places, were killed at this ſiege, for there were ſlain before this Town three <hi>Maſters de Camp,</hi> divers Lords and Gentlemen, above Threeſcore Captains, as many Lieutenants and Enſigns, and above Twenty Thouſand Common Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The next year after, the King himſelf, who was at leaſt the Countenancer of all theſe horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maſſacres, being in the prime of his Youth, not above Twenty five years old, fell ſick of a

He long ſtrugled againſt his diſeaſe, but at laſt betook himſelf to his Bed for about fourteen days before his death, and was ſore tormented with a great effuſion of blood, which iſſued from all parts of his body, and one time, to the terror of thoſe about him, he rouled himſelf in his own blood; A while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died he deſired his Mother to purſue his Enemies to the utmoſt, repeating the ſame with great cagerneſs, and ſaying, <hi>Madam, I pray you heartily to do it,</hi> and ſo expired, <hi>May</hi> 30. 1574.</p>
            <p>And it was obſerved that the reſt of the Chief Agents were ſtrangely cut off; The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> the Kings Brother, afterwards King <hi>Henry the Third</hi> was ſtabbed by a <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine</hi> Monk in the ſame Chamber where he ſate in Council for contriving the late Tragedies.

            <p>Whereupon he was apprehended and caſt into Priſon, and was condemned to be burnt, but he told his Judges, <hi>That his time was not yet come,</hi> and ſo it happened, for he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Ferrara</hi> where he continued in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for Two years, and afterwards Eighteen Months in another Priſon, and was again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Popes Inquiſitors, but ſtill his death was one way or other prevented.</p>
            <p>His Wife and Siſter came to him in Priſon, and weeping pitifully intreated him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and conſider his poor Family: To whom he anſwered, <hi>That his Lord and Maſter had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him not to deny the Truth for his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſake, and that it was too much that for their ſakes he had once fallen already, and therefore deſired them not to ſollicite him any more in that matter, for he knew his end drew near, and therefore he commended them to the Lord.</hi> In a ſhort time after the Pope ſent word <hi>Faninus</hi> ſhould be burnt, at which he very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced and thanked the Meſſenger.

            <p>There was likewiſe one <hi>Dominious</hi> a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier under <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who having received the Goſpel, grew ſo much in knowledge in a ſhort time, that he was able to inſtruct others, whereupon he returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> and taught the People in <hi>Naples, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia,</hi> and ſeveral other places: In a little time after he was apprehended, and readily obeyed the Magiſtrate, ſaying, <hi>That he wondered that the Devil had let him alone ſo long;</hi> And being asked whether he would renounce his Doctrine, He ſaid, <hi>That he maintained no Doctrine of his own, but the Doctrine of Chriſt, which he was

            <p>In the City of <hi>Pavia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> one <hi>Galleacius Trecius</hi> a Gentleman of good Quality, very rich, and bountiful to the poor, embraced the Goſpel, for which being perſecuted he fled from thence, but being afterwards apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was brought before the Lords <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> where he boldly and couragiouſly aſſerted the Truth; whereupon he was condemned to be burnt; next morning he was bound to a ſtake in the Market-place, where he continued till noon, to be gazed at by the People, during which time many of his Friends perſwaded him to recant, but nothing could alter the firm mind of this conſtant Martyr, and Fire being put to him, he quietly ſlept in the Lord. A little before his Execution he heard there were ſome Differences between the Biſhop and the Mayor of the Town, who ſhould be at the coſt of wood to burn him, but to end the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel he ſent them word he would be at the coſt out of his own Goods.</p>
            <p>In the year 1553. one <hi>John Mollius</hi> a famous Preacher was hanged and burnt for preaching the Goſpel, and the next year <hi>Francis Gamba</hi> was condemned upon the ſame account, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he made admirable diſcourſes to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

            <p>Among others who were condemned to be drowned at <hi>Venice,</hi> there was one <hi>Seignior An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Ricetto;</hi> To whom after his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his ſon of about Twelve years of Age came, and with Tears beſeeched his Father to recant, for the ſaving of his own Life, and that he himſelf might not be left fatherleſs, To whom his Father anſwered, <hi>A good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound to forgo Children, goods, yea, and Life it ſelf, for the maintenance of Gods Honour and Glory, for which cauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am now

            <p>A while after one <hi>Francis Spinola</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and committed to Priſon, and being called before the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> he boldly reproved the <hi>Popes</hi> Legate and the other Judges, in that contrary to their Conſciences they perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Truth of God, and told them they were the Off-ſpring of the <hi>Phariſees, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon he had ſentence paſſed upon him, <hi>That he ſhould be drown'd as an Heretick;</hi> to whom he anſwered, <hi>I am no Heretick, but the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> At which words the Popes Legate bid him be ſilent, and told him <hi>that he lied;</hi> The night after he was conveyed into the Sea, and there drowned, bleſſing and praiſing God with invincible Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>In the year 1595, There was a young <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant at <hi>Rome,</hi> who going into a Church, and ſeeing their groſs Idolatry, he was ſo moved that he could not endure the ſight of thoſe impieties, and therefore as the Proceſſion paſſed by him, he ſtept to him that bare the Hoſt and Sacrament, and plucking it out of his hands, threw it on the Ground, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <hi>Ye wretched Idolaters, do ye fall down to a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Bread?</hi> This ſo provoked the People, that they were like to have torn him in Pieces, but he eſcaped death, &amp; was ſent to Priſon, &amp; complaint thereof being made to Pope <hi>Clement the</hi> 8th. he was ſo inraged that he commanded him to be burnt the ſame day, but his Cardinals adviſed to have him kept in Priſon and Examined with Exquiſite Tortures who ſet him on; This they accordingly practiſed, tormenting him with the utmoſt ſeverity, but could get nothing from him, but theſe words, <hi>Such was the will of God;</hi> Then was he adjudged to be led from the Capitol naked to his middle, and to wear on his head the form of a Devil, his breeches to be painted over with Flames of Fire, and ſo to be carried all about the City, and then burnt alive.</p>
            <p>This was Executed upon him, and as he paſſed through the Streets he was mocked and derided of the People, but he prayed fervently to God, and at laſt uttered ſomething againſt the debauched Lives of the Cardinals, which ſo inraged them, that they gagged him; When he came before the Church where he threw down the Idol, his Right hand was cut off by the Hangman, and ſet upon a Pole in the Cart to which he was tyed; Then two Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors with flaming Torches ſcorcht and burnt his Fleſh all the way, ſo that his body was all over bliſtered and bloody, having no

The Fryars urged him to worſhip an Idol, but he turned away his Face, and ſhew'd his Deteſtation of it, and when the Fire ſeized on him, he bowed his head, and quietly reſigned up his Spirit to God.</p>
            <p>The ſame year there was an Ancient Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man that had lain long in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> who was at laſt brought forth, and condemned, after which the Fryars brought a Crucifix to him, importuning him to kiſs and adore it, He ſeeing their importunity, ſaid to them, <hi>If you take not this Idol out of my ſight, I ſhall ſpit upon it;</hi> The Fryars hearing this ſent him away immediately to the Fire, where with great Courage and Conſtancy he reſigned up his Spirit to God.</p>

               <p>If any chance to make his eſcape, they have many devices to fetch him and find him again, one of them is by making his Picture to the Life, and ſending it about by their Apparitors and Promoters, who are commonly the greateſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:174108:58"/>Villairs in the Countrey, and will ſwear any thing againſt the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>After the Priſoner has been ſix or eight Months in Gaol, he is brought before the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors</hi> who tell him that they have deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his caſe, and have found that he doth not declare the whole Truth, and therefore they are reſolved <hi>he ſhall be rackt,</hi> that they may draw from him by force, what by fair means he will not acknowledge, and then they adviſe him rather to confeſs voluntarily and thereby avoid that pain and danger that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him; but whether he confeſs or not, it is the ſame thing, for to the rack he muſt go, to be compelled to confeſs more.</p>
               <p>Then is the poor Priſoner led into a deep and dark Dangeon under Ground where the Rack ſtandeth, paſſing through many doors before he come to it, becauſe the terrible cryes and ſchreiks of the tormented ſhould not be heard. Then the Lords Inquiſitors ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a Scaffold hard by the Rack, and the Torches being lighted, the Hangman or Tormenter comes in, all clothed from Head to Foot in black Canvas, and a long black hood likewiſe, which covereth his Face, having only two holes in it to look out at, which ſight doth many times very much affright the poor Soul, to ſee one in the likeneſs of a Devil come to Torment him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> being ſeated near him, again

               <p>They have another Torment with Fire, which is no whit inferior to the former, and that is by holding the Priſoners Feet over a pan of burning Charcoal, and that the Fire may have the more force, they baſte their Feet with Lard and Bacon.</p>
               <p>If after all theſe and divers other cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they continue conſtant, they are then condemned to death: Then he is clothed in a <hi>Sambernetto</hi> or long Garment painted over with ugly Devils; he hath on his head a high Crown'd Hat, whereon a man is painted burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fire, with many Devils about him, plying him with Fire and Faggot; upon his Tongue a piece of cleft Wood is put, to hinder his ſpeaking, a Cord about his neck, and his hands faſt tyed hehind him.</p>
               <p>All things being finiſhed, they are delivered by the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> into the hands of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who preſently conveys him to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where ſeveral Fryars ſwarm about him, earneſtly perſwading him to deny the Truth, and when they cannot prevail upon him, he is tyed to the Stake, and in an Inſtant the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man breaks his neck, without being perceived, and then they report among the Common People, that he recanted at his laſt hour, and

            <p>After Dinner the Fire was prepared, which ſome thought was only to terrifie him, but it pleaſed God to ſtrengthen him againſt the fear of Death, and ſo he was tied to the Stake, giving his Garments to his Servant, and ſaying thus to him: <hi>Theſe will not profit in the Fire, they will profit thee; After this thou canſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit by me, except the Example of my Death; which I pray thee to remember; for though it be bitter to the Fleſh, and fearful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, yet it is the entrarce into eternal Life, which none ſhall poſſeſs who deny Jeſus Chriſt before this wicked Generation.</hi> And the Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindled, he cried with a loud voice, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit; how long ſhall Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs overwhelm this Realm? and how long wilt thou ſuffer the Tyranny of theſe men?</hi> A Fryar troubling him by crying out, <hi>Turn thou Heretick, call upon our Lady, ſay,</hi> Salve Regina, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he replyed, <hi>Depart from me, and trouble

            <p>In the year 1543. Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> coming to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> cauſed ſeveral Religious perſons to be brought before him, and when he could prove nothing elſe againſt them: He cauſed four men to be hanged upon ſuſpicion that they had eaten a Gooſe upon a <hi>Friday.</hi> And a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a Child ſucking at her breaſt, was drown'd for refuſing to pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Many others were likewiſe Baniſhed and Impriſoned for the Goſpel; and among the reſt <hi>John Rogers</hi> a learned and godly Miniſter, whom he cauſed to be murthered in Priſon, and then thrown over the Wall, giving it out, that by attempting to make his eſcape he broke his neck.</p>
            <p>In the year 1546. Mr. <hi>George Wiſheart</hi> a famous Miniſter was ſent for to appear before
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:174108:64"/>Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> and the other Biſhops at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews;</hi> where a Prieſt was ordered to curſe him, who called him <hi>Renegade, Traitor, Thief,</hi> &amp;c. However, Mr. <hi>Wiſheart</hi> gave them an account of his Faith and Doctrine, but they not being able to anſwer him, immediately condemned him to be Burnt; and preſently a Fire was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared over againſt the Caſtle, and Velvet Cuſhions were laid in the Caſtle-windows for the Cardinal and the reſt of the Prelates to ſee him ſuffer; and for fear he ſhould be reſcued by his friends, all the Caſtle Guns were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the place of his Execution, by the Cardinals order; then with a Rope about his Neck, and a Chain about his middle, he was faſtned to the Stake; and having earneſtly prayed, and exhorted the People, and forgiven his enemies and perſecutors, he ſaid thus: <hi>I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Brethren, Exhort your Prelates to learn the Word of God, that they may be aſhamed to do evil, and learn to do good, or elſe there ſhall come upon them the Wrath of God, which they ſhall not eſchew:</hi> Then the Hangman upon his knees ſaid, <hi>Sir, I pray forgive me, for I am not the cauſe of your Death.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wiſheart</hi> called him to him, and kiſſing his Cheek ſaid, <hi>Lo here is a token that I forgive thee, My heart, do thine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> and ſo he was tyed to the Stake and the fire kindled.</p>
            <p>The Captain of the Caſtle came to him, and bid him be of good Courage; to whom
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:174108:65"/>Mr. <hi>Wiſheart</hi> ſaid, <hi>This fire Torments my Body, but no whit abates my Spirits;</hi> then looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cardinal he ſaid, <hi>He who in ſuch State from that high place feeds his eyes with my Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, within few days ſhall be hanged out at the ſame Window, with as much ſhame and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he there leans with Pride:</hi> then his Breath being ſtopt with the Flames, he gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>This Prophecy was fulfilled in a ſhort time after; for the people being generally diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at the Cruelty uſed againſt Mr. <hi>Wiſheart;</hi> ſeveral perſons conſpired againſt him, and killed him in the Caſtle, and the Provoſt raiſing the Town, came to the Caſtle Gates, crying, <hi>What have you done with my Lord Cardinal? where is he?</hi> To whom they anſwered from within, <hi>Return to your Houſes, for he hath received his reward, and will trouble the World no more.</hi> But they cryed, <hi>We will never depart till we ſee him.</hi> Then was he hanged out at that very window, to ſatisfie them he was dead, and ſo the people departed.</p>
            <p>Shortly after one <hi>Adam Wallace</hi> was Burned likewiſe; and <hi>Henry Foreſt</hi> ſuffered the ſame Cruel Death upon Account of Hereſie.

            </p>
            <p>In the year of our Lord 1641. there brake forth a moſt horrid and Bloody Rebellion and Maſſacre of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, committed on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> a Nation famous for the Birth of divers worthy perſons therein, but none more renowned than that Excellent, Learned and Religious Perſon, <hi>James Uſher,</hi> late Ld. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Lord Primate of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> who amongſt many other extraordinary Gifts and Graces which it pleaſed the Almighty to beſtow upon him, was wonderfully endued with a Spirit of Prophecy; from which among
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:174108:66"/>many other things he foretold this bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion forty years before it came to paſs, in a Sermon which he preached at <hi>Dublin</hi> in the Year 1601. where from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 4.6. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing concerning the Prophets bearing the Iniquity of <hi>Judah</hi> forty days, the Lord therein appointing a day for a Year, he made this direct application in relation to the Connivance at Popery at that time. <hi>From this Year,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will I reckon the ſin of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that thoſe whom you now embrace ſhall be your Ruin, and you ſhall bear your Iniquity:</hi> which Prediction proved exactly true; for from that time 1601. to the year 1641. was juſt forty years, in which it is notoriouſly known that the Rebellion and deſtruction of <hi>Ireland</hi> happened; and which was acted by thoſe Popiſh Prieſts, Jeſuits and other Papiſts which were then connived at.</p>
            <p>For the Jeſuits, Prieſts and Friars were the chief Inſtigators to this horrid Maſſacre, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually incenſing and ſtirring up the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Commonalty to ſhew the utmoſt of their Zeal therein, and this without any provocation given by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> for it was obſerved, that they had all the Liberty they could reaſonably deſire, and that there was not any reaſon for ſuch Cruel Proceedings againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but only for that damnable and unpardonable ſin of being Proteſtants: And the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy the more to engage the deluded <hi>Papiſts</hi> to murther them, every where loudly declaimed, <hi>That they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:174108:66"/>were Hereticks, and not fit to be ſuffered any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger amongſt them; that it was no more ſin to kill one of them, than to kill a Dog, and that it was a mortal and unpardonable ſin to relieve or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect any of them.</hi> And when their buſineſs was ſo fixt that they did not fear any miſcarriage, the ſucceſs of this <hi>Great Deſign</hi> was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Publick Prayers, as tending very much to the advancement of the <hi>Catholick cauſe;</hi> and they likewiſe maliciouſly repreſented to the People the ſevere proceedings againſt the Papiſts in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things being in a readineſs, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Execution of this Damnable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; but their proceeding therein was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> only ſtripping the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Proteſtants, and turning them out of Doors naked in the cold and ſnow, others cruelly Murdering man, woman and child, without the leaſt compaſſion; but they all reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point, that by all manner of ways and means they would univerſally deſtroy and root the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Nay the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo inveterately malicious againſt them, that they would not endure the very ſound of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but puniſhed thoſe that ſpake <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the names of <hi>Engliſh</hi> places they changed, into Old <hi>Iriſh.</hi> In ſome places they killed the Cows and Sheep, meerly becauſe they were <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and ſometimes they cut off their Legs, or a piece out of their Buttocks, and ſo left
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:174108:67"/>them to live in pain; and in other places thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cattel that they could not devour, they kill'd them, and left them in great multitudes ſtinking upon the Ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts gave the Sacrament to divers of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> upon Condition that they ſhould neither ſpare Man, Woman, nor Child of the Proteſtants, ſaying, <hi>That it did them a great deal of good to waſh their hands in their Blood.</hi> Some of their Prieſts Excommunicated all that ſhould from thenceforth relieve or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any <hi>Engliſh, Scotch,</hi> or <hi>Welſhman,</hi> or give them Alms at their Doors, whereby many were Famiſhed to Death. Yea the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Monks and Fryers exhorted them with Tears not to ſpare the <hi>Engliſh</hi> but, utterly to deſtroy them; nay they boaſted that when they had made an end of them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would go over into <hi>England,</hi> and would not leave the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> under Heaven; and their Prieſts told them, <hi>It was as lawful to kill an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man as to kill a Sheep or a Dog; and that it was no more Pity or Conſcience to take their Eſtates from them, than to take a Bone out of a Dogs mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day before this Horrid Maſſacre began, the Prieſts gave the people a diſmiſſion at Maſs, with full liberty to go out and take Poſſeſſion of all their Lands, which they pretended we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were juſtly forfeited by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Rebellions and Treaſons againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:174108:67"/>They further told them, that they might lawfully ſtrip, rob, and deſpoil them of all their Goods and Chattels, <hi>The Proteſtants being</hi> (as they ſaid) <hi>worſe than Dogs, for their were Devils, and worſhiped the Devil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Killing of ſuch was meritorious, and an Excellent Preſervative againſt the Pains of Purgatory; ſince the Bodies of ſuch Catholicks as ſhould die in this Quarrel, would not be cold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Souls ſhould aſcend up into Heaven; ſo that they need not fear the Pains of Purgatory:</hi> which occaſioned ſome of theſe Murthering Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains to boaſt, after they had maſſacred many of the <hi>Engliſh, That if they ſhould die preſently, they ſhould go ſtraight to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Horrid Rebellion firſt began, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen pretended great kindneſs to ſome of their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Neighbours, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to put their Goods and Cattel into their hands, engaging that they would ſecure them from the rage of the Rabble; which made the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſo confident, becauſe of former familiarity, that they gave them Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of all they had; nay, they digged up ſome of their beſt things which they had hidden in the grounds, and put them into their hands, whereby they got vaſt quantities of Goods into their hands; and yet like <hi>True Papiſts,</hi> they cheated them of it all; nay, which was more barbarous, they promiſed the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that if they would be contented to loſe their Goods,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:174108:68"/>they and their Wives and Children, ſhould peaceably depart the Country; and yet when they had got all they had, they inhumanely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>urthered them.</p>
            <p>In one place there was no leſs than Twenty two Widdows, who were firſt robbed, and then ſtript ſtark naked, and when in a houſe they had covered themſelves with Straw, the bloody <hi>Papiſts</hi> threw in burning Straw among them, on purpoſe to burn them together: And in a while after they brake forth into ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Cruelties, bloody Maſſacres and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as would make the heart of any Chriſtian to ake, and his Ears to tingle at the Relation of them.</p>
            <p>In the Caſtle of <hi>Liſgol</hi> above an hundred and twenty Men, Women and Children were burnt together: Another Caſtle was delivered to one of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Commanders, upon condition their lives ſhould be ſaved; but as ſoon as he entred, he cruelly murdered and deſtroyed them all without mercy.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Portendown</hi> Bridge, a thouſand Men. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children were drowned in the River; and it was teſtified upon Oath, that nine days after there was the Apparition of a Man bolt upright in the Water, breaſt-high, with his hands lifted up to Heaven, and that he was ſeen ſeveral times in that poſture, from <hi>December</hi> to the end of <hi>Lent,</hi> at which time ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army paſſing that way, ſaw it likewiſe; after which it vaniſhed away.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:174108:68"/>
            <p>One <hi>Elizabeth Price</hi> made Oath, that ſhe with other Women whoſe Husbands and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were drowned in that place, hearing of thoſe Apparitions, went thither one Evening, at which time they ſaw a Woman riſe out of the River breaſt-high, her hair hanging down, which was as white as Snow, and ſo was her skin, and that ſhe often cryed out, <hi>Revenge, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Revenge;</hi> which ſo affrighted them, that they went away.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Queens County,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> his Wife, five Children and a Maid, were all hanged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and then cut down and put into a hole; the youngeſt Child, though it was hanged, was not quite dead when it was put in, but put up its hands and cryed, <hi>Mammy, Mammy,</hi> and yet theſe Villains without mercy buried it alive.</p>
            <p>They ſtripped a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> and knocked him down for dead, but he afterwards recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, went into the Town naked, whereupon they hewed him all to pieces: They alſo ript up his Wifes belly, ſo that the Child dropped out: They likewiſe hanged up divers other Women with Child, and ripping them up, they gave their Infants to be devoured by Dogs and Swine. In one place they ſet a Caſtle on fire wherein were many Proteſtants, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycingly ſaid among themſelves, <hi>Oh how ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they fry!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one place they burnt two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, and ſaid it was <hi>Hell-fire</hi> they burnt; they cut
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:174108:69"/>other Bibles to pieces, and burnt them, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to do the like to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles: And in one place they took a Bible and laid it in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe barbarous Villains cauſed ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to carry their Aged Parents to the River, and drown them: ſome Wives were forced to help to hang their Husbands; in one Town they cauſed a young Man to murther his own Father, and then hanged him up: in another place they forced a Woman to kill her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and then cauſed her Son to kill his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then immediately hanged her Son: and their curſed malice was thereby ſhewn, that they might as much as in them lay, deſtroy Soul and Body together.

            <p>Yea they boaſted that the day was their own, and that ere long they would not leave one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Rogue living, but would utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy every one that had but a drop of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood in him: yea they vowed, they would not leave one <hi>Engliſh</hi> beaſt alive, nor any of their breed.</p>
            <p>Alas! who can comprehend the Sighs, the Groans, the trembling and aſtoniſhment of theſe poor Innocent Souls, to ſind themſelves ſo ſuddenly ſurprized, and that without remedy; What Schrieks, Cries, and bitter Lamentations were there of Husbands, Wives, Children, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Friends, howling and weeping, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves without all hope of deliverance from their preſent woful Miſeries and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

            <p>AFter having briefly Epitomized the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Cruelties and ſlaughters of this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Vaſſals, throughout <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> let us now return home, and ſee if our own Countrey has eſcaped betterthan our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Engliſhmen are generally accounted to be of a merciful nature, and pitiful diſpoſition, apt to be touched with the miſeries of others, &amp; are not in their own natures bloody, barbarous or Cruel; what then may be the cauſe of thoſe dreadful marks of Rage and Fury that have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:174108:70"/>been ſeen among us? How has this Fair Iſland been made an <hi>Accldama,</hi> a Field of Skulls and Martyrs bones? All this we ſhall ſind proceeds from corrupt principles of Religion. <hi>I doubt not,</hi> (ſays a worthy Divine) <hi>but Papiſts are made like other men; Nature hath not generally given them ſuch Savage and Cruel Diſpoſitions, but their Religion hath made them ſo; I am loth to ſay it, and yet I am confident it is true, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papiſts would have been excellent Perſons and very good men, if their Religion had not hindred them, if the Doctrines, and Principles of their Church had not ſpoiled their natural Diſpoſition. Good God! that any thing that is called Religion ſhould ſo preſently ſtrip men of all Humanity, and transform the mild and gentle Race of Mankind into Wolves and Tigers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Popery that alters the Nature of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi> and makes them act like <hi>Turks, Infidels</hi> or <hi>Barbarians:</hi> its principles infect the Blood, and invenom the Soul; inſtead of being Meek and humble, it makes them Proud and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; inſtead of performing the Commands of Chriſt, it makes men obey the Pope, though never ſo contrary to Religion. If our Bleſſed Saviour ſays, <hi>Hurt no man, pray for your Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, ſubmit to Magiſtrates and Governours;</hi> The Pope and his Doctrines ſay, <hi>Kill every man, that is not of your Religion; Curſe thoſe that diſobey your Commands: Kill, Stab, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your Kings or Governours.</hi> This is the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:174108:71"/>Doctrine, and theſe are the Principles and Commands of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>It is ſome hundreds of years ſince this Bloody Beaſt of perſecution began to ſhew his Fangs and armed Claws in this Kingdom; and it was almoſt as ſoon perceived and teſtified againſt by ſome good men in thoſe times.

            <p>But ſince the Papiſts impertinently urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us the Newneſs of our Religion, and that it was not known before <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> days, we ſhall produce much more early Teſtimonies againſt the Errors and Abuſes in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> For we find in the Year 884. <hi>John Patrick Erigena,</hi> a <hi>Britan,</hi> who was ordained the firſt Reader in <hi>Oxford</hi> by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> was afterward Condemned and Martyred by the Pope, for writing a Book concerning the Sacrament. And in the year 960. many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Divines wore the <hi>Mark of the Beaſt</hi> in their faces, being by the Popes order Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:174108:71"/>in the Faces with hot Irons, for Diſſenting in many things about the <hi>Maſs, Purgatory, Monkery,</hi> and the like; and for ſaying, that <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that Cloiſters were the Nurſes of Sodomy. In the year 1126. one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and a Preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, was Butchered at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for Preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pride of the Prelates, and the wicked lives of the Prieſts.

            <p>After which almoſt in every Year it pleaſed God to raiſe up ſeveral learned and worthy men to teſtify againſt the Horrid Corruptions of <hi>Rome,</hi> both by Speaking, Writing and Diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them.

In the Year 1417, the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was Burnt in S. <hi>Giles's Fields: John Purey</hi> and <hi>Will.

In the Year 1447. <hi>Humfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was murdered by the Papiſts, for being a favourer of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and other Preachers of the Truth; and divers others were many ways perſecuted for the ſake of Religion, before the riſing of <hi>Luther;</hi> God having in all Ages raiſed up ſome to Teſtifie to the Truth, and to maintain the purity of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe Divines, Learned and great men, there were ſeveral other good men
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:174108:72"/>of a meaner quality who openly owned the Truth, and ſuffered for the ſame; and as the number of the profeſſors grew greater, who now began to be called <hi>Lollards,</hi> ſo Perſecution grew hotter, and the Rage and Malice of the Papiſts increaſed.

In the Year 1514. <hi>Richard Hun</hi> was murdered in the <hi>Lollards Tower,</hi> and afterwards burnt; <hi>John Brown, John Stileman,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Man</hi> were burnt in <hi>Smithfield; Robert Couſin</hi> was burnt at <hi>Buckingham, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher

            <p>There were two things about this time that very much increaſed the Profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in <hi>England;</hi> One was the appearance of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> in the World, who boldly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truth, and loudly Declaimed againſt the corruptions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; another thing was the Art of Printing, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be common, whereby the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was the more eaſily promulgated and Diſperſed through every Countrey, and in all Languages.</p>
            <p>This allarum'd the Pope and his Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clergy, who were afraid to have their wicked Doctrines and Practices diſcovered to the people, and thereupon they began to rage, and beſtir themſelves, raiſing Perſecution, and making Deſtruction and Slaughter in all places throughout the Kingdom againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as they were now called. In the Year 1519. ſeveral Proteſtants were apprehended at <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>

            <p>About the ſame time Sir <hi>John Blage</hi> of the Kings Privy Chamber was falſly accuſed to

But it pleaſed God that in the midſt of theſe ſubtil Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, for the deſtruction of his Goſpel and Servants, to take away King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth within four Months after the Proclamation; and thereby all their hopes and projects were utterly diſappointed.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:174108:75"/>Religion was eſtabliſhed, and Popery and Superſtition aboliſhed; for he cauſed all Images to be demoliſhed, and as Idolatrous, to be taken out of all Churches within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; the Learned m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it pleaſed God in a ſhort time to take him to himſelf: for in the Seventh Year of his Reign, and the Seventeenth Year of his Age, he was taken with a lingring ſickneſs; during which time a Marriage was concluded between the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley</hi> eldeſt Son to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe mother being then alive was Daughter to <hi>Mary</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths ſecond Siſter.</p>
            <p>The Marriage being finiſht, and the King every day more ſick than other, ſo that he ſeemed paſt Recovery, the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> being ambitious to advance his Family, perſwaded the King that the Church and the True Religion would be in great danger if he did not chooſe a pious <hi>Succeſſer;</hi> and that it was the part of a good Prince to ſet aſide all other reſpects, when the Glory of God and the good of his Subjects were concerned.</p>
            <p>The King partly for his great deſire to have

            <p>The Lady <hi>Mary</hi> having received this anſwer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew further from the City, and the Council being ſenſible of her ſtout and unquiet diſpoſition, they raiſed an Army, which was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> The Lady <hi>Mary</hi> went into <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> gathering ſuch aid of the Commons as ſhe could, and kept her ſelf in <hi>Framingham</hi> Caſtle, to whom the <hi>Suffolk</hi> men firſt reſorted, who being always forward in promoting the Goſpel, promiſed her their aid and aſſiſtance, provided ſhe would make no alteration of the Proteſtant Religion, as it was eſtabliſhed by her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Edward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this ſhe readily agreed, and confirmed it with ſuch Vows and Proteſtations, that none could ſuſpect her; whereupon they joined with her: and thus by the help of the Proteſtants ſhe vanquiſhed the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and his Army, and was ſettled in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but ſhe ſoon forgot her promiſes, for theſe very <hi>Suffolk</hi> men obſerving that Popery would be re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, they Petitioned to her to perform her word to them; at which ſhe was extreamly diſpleaſed, and told them, <hi>Foraſmuch as you who are Members deſire to rule your Head, you ſhall one day find that Members muſt obey, not ſeek to rule;</hi> Yea one of the chief of theſe men, Mr. <hi>Dob</hi> by name, ſhe cauſed for the Terror of others to be ſet in the Pillory ſeveral times, and divers others that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Supplications to her not to ſet up Popery, ſhe cauſed to be ſent to priſon.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> being ſetled in the Kingdom, the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> her Father the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and her Husband the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> were ſoon after Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed; and the Queen ſoon diſcovered her diſaffection to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, by diſplacing all the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Biſhops, as <hi>Poinet, Ridley, Scorie, Hooper, Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale;</hi> and by releaſing out of the Tower <hi>Stephen Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> whom ſhe made Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>England<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>London.</hi> Then the Queen publiſht a Proclamation, that ſhe was reſolved to obſerve and maintain the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> wherein ſhe was bred up, requiring all her Subjects quietly to embrace the ſame.</p>
            <p>A while after this, <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardiner</hi> begun a cruel and bloody perſecution upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and made them fall in heaps: For Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> all famous men, were condemned and burnt for Hereſie. In the Year 1555, <hi>Thomas Tomkins</hi> (whoſe hand B. <hi>Bonner</hi> burnt in Priſon to try his conſtancy) was afterward burnt in <hi>Smithfield; William Hunter</hi> was cruelly handled, and then burnt.

            </p>
            <p>About this time came a Letter from King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> that Hereticks were not proſecuted with ſuch ſeverity as they ought to be; which eaſily prevailed with <hi>Bonner,</hi> who was ready enough for Cruelty, and thereupon condemned <hi>John Symſon</hi> and <hi>John Ardeley</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who were burnt there: <hi>Thomas Hawks, Thomas Watts, Thomas Oſmund, William Bamford, Thomas Osburn,</hi> all of <hi>Cogſhall</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being ſent up to <hi>Bonner,</hi> for not receiving the Sacrament at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> they were condemned and burnt in ſeveral places in <hi>Eſſex. John Bland, Nicholas Shetterden, Humfrey Middleton, John Frankeſh,</hi> were all burnt: And a few days after, <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Hall, Chriſtopher Wade, John Harpole,</hi> and <hi>Margery Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> were burnt in <hi>Kent. Dirick Carver, John Launder, Thomas Iveſon, James Abbies, John Denley, John Newman Patrick Packingham, Richard Hook</hi> and <hi>John Newman,</hi> were likewiſe burnt for Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The Priſons were now full in every place, and ſix men were Condemned and burnt at <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:174108:77"/>thing but Cruelty and Oppreſſion was to be ſeen through the whole Land: Whereupon the Queens Commiſſioners for the more quick diſpatch took out ten of the Priſoners, whom they ſent to B. <hi>Bonner,</hi> and being examined by him about the Sacrament, they conſtantly adhering to the Truth, were condemned and burnt in ſeveral places. <hi>Robert Samuel</hi> a Miniſter ſuffered Martyrdom at <hi>Norwich;</hi> two others at <hi>Ipſwich;</hi> five more in the Dioceſs of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> the famous <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1556. their wicked and bloody rage ſtill continued, the Land was all in a Flame, and Blood and Cruelty reigned in every place: For there were ſeven burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> in one fire; four more in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was burnt in <hi>Oxford.</hi> And to conclude, though the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was the ſhorteſt of any Prince ſince the Conqueſt, except King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, yet in her days there was more Chriſtian blood ſpilt for Religion than in any Kings Reign whatſoever, ſince <hi>Lucius</hi> the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King eſtabliſhed Chriſtianity in this Land; for in the five years of her Reign, there periſhed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Flames, for the Profeſſion of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, no leſs than two Hundred ſeventy ſeven perſons, of all Ages and both Sexes: there ſuffered five Biſhops and Archbiſhops, twenty one Divines, eight Gentlemen, four Tradeſmen, an hundred Husbandmen, Servants and Labourers; twenty ſix Wives, twenty Widows and Virgins; two Boys, and two Infants; one in the Iſle of <hi>Guernſey</hi> who ſpringing out of his Mothers Womb as ſhe was burning at the Stake, was moſt inhumanely thrown in again and burnt for a young Heretick. And beſides theſe, there were ſixty four perſecuted for their Religion, whereof ſeven were whipt, ſixteen periſhed in Priſon, twelve were buried in Dunghills, and many more lay condemned, but were ſaved by the Death of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Succeſſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> put a ſtop to the cruel rage of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:174108:78"/>of the Pope vaniſhed, and Peace, Reſt and Liberty for all the good People of the Nation enſued.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> out of their extreme Loyalty to the Pope, thought it a ſin to live peaceably under an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Prince: Eſpecially when two Popes had thundered out Excommunications againſt her, curſing her, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Subjects from their Allegiance towards her, and threatning them under danger of the Wrath of God, not to aſſiſt her, but to imploy all their Power to bring her to condign puniſhment, and promiſing rewards to all perſons who ſhould lay hands upon this proſcribed Woman, which was to be paid out of the Treaſury of the Church, together with a full pardon of all their ſins who ſhould engage againſt her.</p>
            <p>But when the Pope and his Accomplices ſaw, that all this would not effect their deſires, the Queens Subjects being too faithful to engage in any ſuch villanous deſigns, they then proceed to ſecret Plots and Attempts againſt her: As that wherein the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Robert Biddulph</hi> were engaged, in the year 1566. and for which <hi>Northumberland</hi> Suffered at <hi>York,</hi> and after that <hi>Leonard Daves</hi> deſigned miſchiefs againſt her with the like ill ſucceſs. In the year 1578. the Invaſion of <hi>Ireland</hi> at the great charges of the Pope, was happily prevented. The next year <hi>James Fitz-morris</hi> is ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with <hi>Saunders,</hi> who carried conſecrated Banners to them. The next year after <hi>San Joſeph</hi> was likewiſe ſent thither with ſeven hundred <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers, and the Popes promiſe of ten hundred thouſand Crowns, to carry on the work of Rebellion; and to them joined the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> and his Brothers; but they were all happily defeated.</p>
            <p>But theſe projects likewiſe failing, they conſpire the death of the Queen, and make ſeveral Attempts to murther her; firſt by one <hi>Somervile</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> Prieſts; and one of them being condemned was found ſecretly murdered, for fear he ſhould diſcover others. After this followed the practices of <hi>Mendoza</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador here, with <hi>Throgmorton</hi> and <hi>Parry,</hi> who had
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:174108:78"/>Letters of plenary Indulgence, Pardon &amp; Remiſſion of all their ſins ſent them by the Pope, for killing the Queen; And the ſame year, <hi>Savage</hi> made the like vow to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Queen, being inſtigated thereto by <hi>Gifford</hi> and <hi>Hodgſon</hi> two Popiſh Prieſts.</p>
            <p>A while after <hi>Babington</hi> upon the ſame principles er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to commit the like wicked act, by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one <hi>Ballard</hi> a Jeſuit, but being happily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, divers of them were condemned, and juſtly executed for the ſame, and were regiſtred for Saints and Martyrs in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Calender. Yet by the means of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador one <hi>Stafford</hi> and <hi>Moody</hi> were dealt withal to commit the like Villany, <hi>Moody</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to lay a bag of Gun-powder under the Queens Bed-Chamber.</p>
            <p>But this like the reſt being happily prevented, the Pope ſtirs up his Dear Son, <hi>Philip the Second</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> openly to invade <hi>England,</hi> which he did in the Year 1588. who though in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> time he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended great kindneſs to the Queen, yet now in hopes of gaining <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which the Pope had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, he comes to take poſſeſſion thereof, with a vaſt and (as the Pope Chriſtened it) <hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> conſiſting of an hundred and thirty tall Ships, extraordinary well furniſhed, and containing fifty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Thouſand eight hundred and eight Tun, wherein were Eight Thouſand ſix hundred Seamen, Twenty Thouſand Souldiers, two thouſand Galley Slaves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Gentlemen and Voluntiers in abundance; ſo that there was ſcarce a Family in <hi>Spain,</hi> who had not either a Son, Brother, or Couſin in the Fleet.</p>
            <p>There were likewiſe aboard them two thouſand ſix hundred and thirty great Ordnance, with Powder, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Match, Muskets, Pikes, Spears, Swords, and all things proportionable, with Knives, Daggers, Skeins, Chains and Whips, to Torment and cut the Throats of the poor <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants;</hi> and with them came ſwarms of thoſe Locuſts called <hi>Capuchins, Mendicants Jeſuits,</hi> and other Officers of the <hi>Sacred Order</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> as they prophanely call it.</p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:174108:79"/>
            <p>And beſides all this, there lay in <hi>Flanders</hi> fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand old Souldiers, and two hundred eighty eight Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ready to tranſport them, under the command of the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> all the King of <hi>Spains</hi> beſt Souldiers, even as far as <hi>America,</hi> being drawn forth for this <hi>Holy War:</hi> The whole of this Expedition having coſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> twelve Millions of Crowns before their ſetting forth; the Pope likewiſe contributing a Million of Gold to ſo pious a deſign. But the goodneſs and mercy of God at that time defended <hi>England</hi> from the gaping Jaws of deſtruction, and diſcomfited this Mighty <hi>Armado,</hi> and all its mighty preparations, and ſent them home full of ſhame, loſs and confuſion; ſo that of one hundred thirty four Ships that ſet ſail out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> only thirty three returned: the <hi>Spaniard</hi> loſing in this Voyage Eighty one Ships, and above thirteen thouſand five hundred Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and two thouſand more taken Priſoners in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy being loſt and deſtroyed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Seas, Rocks, Sands and Tempeſts, all ſeeming to conſpire to the defeating of this proud and Inſolent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>But theſe ſort of People will never take notice of Gods Judgments upon their wicked deſigns and enterprizes, and notwithſtanding all this, they ſhut their Eyes and will not ſee that God is againſt them: for they no ſooner recover breath, but they ſend over new Commiſſions, and more curſed Emiſſaries diſguiſed in all ſhapes into <hi>England,</hi> with new Plots, Contrivances and deſigns; <hi>Lopez</hi> and his Confederates, <hi>Cullen, York, Williams, Squire, Hesket,</hi> all enter into a Conſpiracy to kill the Queen, being conſtantly encouraged by the Jeſuits and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters of State. And theſe proving abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in the year 1599. the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> is ſtirred up to make a new Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having the ſame Pardons and Indulgences ſent them as are uſually given by the Popes to thoſe that go to fight againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> And in the year 1601. the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſends a great Fleet of Souldiers to <hi>Kinſale</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the aſſiſtance
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:174108:79"/>of the Rebels. But notwithſtanding all theſe wicked and execrable deſigns, this glorious and Heroick Queen of bleſſed memory, having out-lived Four Kings and Eight Popes, dyed in Peace, and left her flouriſhing Kingdoms to her Succeſſor King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Papiſts being thus diſappointed of their great hopes and expectations, by the ſucceſſion of a Proteſtant King to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby uniting into one Body, <hi>Scotland, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> one would have Imagined that all their contrivances would have been daſht, ſince they could not well think that ſo long &amp; well ſettled a Reformation in Church and State, could very eaſily be broken and confounded; yet ſtill they give not over, but encourage one another in their wickedneſs, and the Pope ſent over two Bulls to deprive King <hi>James</hi> of the Crown, and ſought to raiſe diviſions and diſſentions amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But God continuing to fruſtrate all their deſigns, they now grew as it were deſperate, and entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt barbarous and Helliſh Plot and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that ever was hatched in the Brains or Hearts of men, which is that which we call the <hi>Gunpowder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and which we yearly commemorate upon the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> they deſigning to act it on that day in the year 1605.</p>
            <p>This horrid deſign was contrived by divers Jeſuits, Prieſts, and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, who by undermining the Parliament-Houſe, and planting there Thirty ſix Barrels of Gunpowder, intended by firing the ſame when both Houſes were ſitting, to have blown up and deſtroyed, not only the King as the Head of the Kingdom, but with him his Queen, the Prince, and all the Royal Iſſue, together with the Clergy, Nobility, and the chief of the Gentry of the whole Kingdom; all ſhould have periſhed together at one Blow, and have become a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the enraged Luſts of theſe Bloody-minded Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. A Plot and Villany that no Age can parallel, no Country ever could produce the like, and which was as miraculouſly prevented and detected, at if it were by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:174108:80"/>the immediate finger of God, who diſcovered their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable practices, even within their dark Vaults and Cellars, when the very Train was laid, and fire almoſt put to it: And in this horrid Conſpiracy, <hi>Catesby, Piercy, Faux, Digby, Garnet, Hall,</hi> &amp;c all Popiſh Prieſts, were conſiderable Actors and Promoters, and all ſworn to ſecreſie, with Horrid Oaths and Imprecations, taking the Holy Sacrament, and engaging themſelves one to another thereby, and by their Faith in the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, never to ſhrink from the Execution of this their Helliſh Intention, till they had performed the ſame: They were likewiſe promiſed from abroad Ships and Men, and ten hundred thouſand Crowns to carry on their work.</p>
            <p>And though this horrid Conſpiracy has been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered and made plain, by the confeſſion of ſome of the Conſpirators who were executed, and by writings under their own hands; yet according to their uſual Impudence, which they learned of their Predeceſſor <hi>Nero,</hi> (who when he had ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on Fire, charged it upon the Chriſtians) the Papiſts intended to have laid that wicked Act upon the <hi>Puritans;</hi> and ſince this they have endeavoured to make the world believe that it was a Contrivance of King <hi>James,</hi> thereby endeavouring ſince they could not blow up the King with Gunpowder to blaſt his good Name, and to make him odious to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>But three Kingdoms are not ſo eaſie to be deluded, neither are we ſo horridly impious, to mock God ſo ſolemnly with yearly Prayers and Thankſgivings; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need we think it ſo ſtrange ſince Lyes &amp; Impudence are the grand ſupporters of the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom, without which ſuch a medly of Nonſence and Foolery would be hooted out of the world.</p>
            <p>And from that time to this very day, the Papiſts have been and are the Grand Diſturbers of theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And it is ſufficiently manifeſted that they had no ſmall hand in our late Troubles, ſince which they have continually ſought the ruin and deſtruction of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:174108:80"/>by all manner of curſed ways and methods ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>In the year 1666. <hi>Sept.</hi> 2. about two a Clock in the Morning, there began a ſad and lamentable Fire in a Bakers Houſe in <hi>Pudding-Lane</hi> near <hi>Fiſhſtreet-hill, London,</hi> which raged with extream Violence, being accompanyed with a ſtrong North-eaſt wind, ſo that deſpiſing all means uſed for its extinguiſhing, it ſpread far, and near ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with and ſometimes againſt the wind, and ſo continued for the ſpace of near four days, till it had burnt down thirteen thouſand two hundred houſes, which ſtood upon three hundred thirty ſeven Acres of Ground within the Walls, and ſixty three Acres three Roods without; beſides eighty nine Pariſh Churches, the moſt ſpacious Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> the <hi>Great Guild-hall,</hi> the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> many Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Halls of Companies, ſeveral principal City Gates, and other publick Edifices; which was accompanyed with the loſs of vaſt quantities of rich Houſhold-ſtuff, and Goods of all ſorts, but eſpecially four or five; that is, Books of which alone were loſt near the value of an hundred and fifty thouſand pound; Tobacco, Sugar, Wiens, and Plumbs, being heavy goods: So that the whole loſs is computed by an Ingenious Perſon to be Nine Millions and nine hundred thouſand pounds; and yet not above ſix or eight perſons through Gods Providence were burnt in this vaſt deſolation.</p>
            <p>Upon the Eighteenth of <hi>September,</hi> the Parliament met, and the Commons appointed a Committee to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the Cauſes of the Fire, &amp; to take Informations concerning it; and in a ſhort time ſo many and ſuch very conſiderable Informations were brought in, that it was no longer doubtful but the Papiſts were the Contrivers and Managers of this dreadful Fire.</p>
            <p>For among other things it plainly appeared, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party were made acquainted with it before it happened: For Mr. <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Ratcliff</hi> depoſed. That being in diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Richard Langhorn</hi> (ſince Executed for High Treaſon) in <hi>February,</hi> before the Fire,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:174108:81"/>concerning Religion, <hi>Langhorn</hi> took him by the hand and ſaid to him, <hi>You expect great things in ſixty ſix, and think that</hi> Rome <hi>will be deſtroy'd, but what if it be</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</p>
            <p>A <hi>French-man</hi> told one <hi>Elizabeth Styles,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> before the Fire, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maids would love the <hi>French men</hi> better when there was not an houſe left ſtanding between <hi>Temple-Barr,</hi> and <hi>London-Bridge:</hi> To which ſhe replyed, <hi>She hoped his eyes would never ſee that:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>This will happen betwixt</hi> June <hi>and</hi> October.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> in his Narrative, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. ſays, That in <hi>July</hi> 1678. being in diſcourſe with one <hi>Strange</hi> a Jeſuit, <hi>Strange</hi> told him that they had got fourteen thouſand pound by the Fire of <hi>London</hi> in 1666. and that they ſpent ſeven hundred Fire-balls to effect their Villany; and that when the Fire-Merchants were at work, then other Papiſts both men and women were imployed by them to plunder what they could; that they had a Warehouſe in <hi>Wildſtreet,</hi> where ſome of their ſtolen Goods were laid, and other Goods they concealed in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> as Hollands, Cambricks, Fine Cloth, and ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantities of Plate, and a Box of Jewels. Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> asked <hi>Strange,</hi> How the King came to eſcape (for it ſeems his death was deſigned then?) <hi>Strange</hi> replyed, <hi>Indeed they were reſolved to have out him off, but ſeeing him ſo induſtrious about Quenching the Fire, they could not find in their hearts to do it; Strange</hi> ſaid, there were about Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſix employ'd in it; and <hi>John Grove</hi> ſince Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for high Treaſon, told Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that he fired <hi>Southwork,</hi> and that the Society of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> got two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds by that Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Hubert,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Papiſt of <hi>Normandy,</hi> began this Fire in <hi>London,</hi> being hired thereto by <hi>Stephen Peidelow</hi> likewiſe a Papiſt; and <hi>Hubert</hi> obſerving the ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that followed, could not be quiet till he had freely diſcovered the whole matter; Affirming that by <hi>Peidelows</hi> directions he put a Fire-ball to the end of a long pole, and lighting it with a piece of Match put it into the Bakers window, and ſtayed till the houſe was

            <p>Now as to the Means whereby this was to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the firſt and chief was, By Murdering his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, which was to be accompliſht either by Piſtolling of him, wherein <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; or by Stabbing, and this to be done by <hi>Conyers</hi> and <hi>Anderton, Benedictine Monks,</hi> or four <hi>Iriſh Ruffians.</hi> Or laſtly by Poyſoning, for which Money was paid to the Undertaker.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another means was by firing <hi>London, Weſtminſter</hi> and the parts adjacent, and likewiſe other Cities and great Towns in <hi>England,</hi> immediately upon the Murder of his Majeſty.</p>

Care was taken likewiſe about ſecuring <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Great ſums of Money were provided for the neceſſary charge of this mighty undertaking, and it was diſcourſed, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had purchaſed a great Eſtate <hi>per Annum</hi> for that purpoſe; and that they had a great Stock in ready Money; and were to receive Eleven thouſand Crowns from <hi>Rome,</hi> Ten thouſand pound from <hi>Spain,</hi> and Ten thouſand from <hi>France,</hi> beſides ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very conſiderable ſums, for promoting this vaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:174108:84"/>whereby it appears that this <hi>Horrid Plot</hi> is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be parallel'd in any Hiſtory, conſidering that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any provocation ſo many Thouſand Proteſtants were deſigned for ſlaughter, deſtruction and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, only to advance and promote the Holy Catholick Religion, as they falſly call that Chaos of Blaſphemy and Cruelty.</p>

            <p>THough the barbarous cruelty and Treachery of of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is already ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and the World thereby fully convinced that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Treaties are not to be relled on, yet their new and horrid Barbarities in <hi>France</hi> ſince the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> and thoſe other Violations of the moſt Sacred Oaths, and Ingagements, may convince the moſt obſtinate that they make it a point of Religion to deſtroy Proteſtants, over whom that Church pretends to have a Soveraign and Abſolute Dominion, of which Thouſands of <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:174108:87"/>now in <hi>England</hi> confirm the truth, who having felt the ſmart of a ſevere Perſecution in <hi>France</hi> are fled from thence to avoid the extream fury and inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble violence thereof; But though the generality may have heard much diſcourſe of the <hi>French</hi> Perſecutions, and have been very bountiful in relieving theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble People, yet I ſuppoſe few know the particular Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities and Inhumanities which they have ſuffered from their mercileſs Enemies; To inform them therefore I have thought fit to make a brief abſtract of ſome noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Villanies committed by the Papiſts againſt them, ſince a large Volume would not contain the innumerable Cruelties they have exerciſed upon theſe innocent Souls.</p>
            <p>It is known to all intelligent Perſons that for the great Services which the Proteſtants performed to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth (called the <hi>Great</hi>) King of <hi>France</hi> and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to the preſent King in aſſerting his Rights to the Crown againſt the Papiſts who were then in Rebellion againſt him; that great Prince being willing to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his gratitude to them, confirmed to them an entire Liberty of Conſcience by a Law called the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> whereby they were to enjoy all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th was very young when he aſcended the Throne, and ſoon after the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> raiſed a Civil War in the Kingdom againſt him, being aſſiſted by the Papiſts, but the Proteſtants by their Signal Loyalty to him overthrew the deſigns of his Enemies, and ſetled that Crown on his head which he wears to this day, and of which he pretended then to be ſo ſenſible that he made a publick Declaration of it at St <hi>Germains</hi> in 1652. And every one endeavoured to proclaim loudeſt the merits of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the Queen Mother her ſelf acknowledging, <hi>That they had preſerved the State;</hi> Though

They firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their Churches and Exerciſes of Religion by eſtabliſhing Commiſſioners, who pretended the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants had exceeded the grants that were allowed them, though their Proceedings herein were ſo very unjuſt that the Judges often received order to condemn them, when by the great evidence of their right they declared they could not in Conſcience do it; Yea in civil affairs and controverſies about Lands, Houſes, or Debts, Religion was always urged, the Monks, Prieſts and the reſt of that Crew crying out in Courts of Juſtice, <hi>I plead againſt an Heretick, againſt an Enemy to the State, and to the Kings Religion, whom he would have to be deſtroy'd;</hi> So that the Judge durſt not declare in their favour, though never ſo much wronged, leſt he ſhould be counted a Favourer of Hereticks; And upon complaint, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were told, <hi>You have your remedy in your own hands; why don't you turn Catholicks?</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:174108:88"/>they were perjured villains, yet they countenanced and incouraged them in ſwearing things that they knew were abſolutely falſe, whereby many innocent and virtuous perſons were whipt, and ſent to the Gallies for Slaves; But the Miniſters ſuffered moſt thereby, who ſeldom preached a Sermon but that a Troop of Prieſts and Monks were preſent as Informers, and Obſervators, who charged them with things they never thought of, by turning them into a contrary meaning; Yea pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divine their thoughts and make them criminal; For if a Miniſter ſpake of <hi>Egypt, Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They then proceeded to deprive Proteſtants of all Publick Offices and Imployments, directly contrary to the Edict of <hi>Henry</hi> the great, who made an expreſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to the contrary; Yea to hinder them from excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing ſeveral Arts and Trades whereby to maintain their Families; This was in 1669, and in 1680, and 1681. all Lords and Gentlemen were ordered to diſcharge all their Proteſtant Officers and Servants; Nay they would not ſuffer any Proteſtant Mid-Wives to do their Office, but expreſly ordained that no Women ſhould receive any aſſiſtance in that condition but from <hi>Popiſh</hi> Mid-Wives; by theſe ſtrange and unheard of Methods many thouſand Perſons and Families were reduced to miſery and ruin. But becauſe ſome could ſtill ſuſtain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there was an Order of Council that the <hi>New-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> as they call them, that is, thoſe who turned from Proteſtants to Papiſts, ſhould not be obliged to pay their debts in three years, which fell heavily upon the Proteſtants who were generally concerned with them, and hereby they found the ſecret to recompence the Apoſtates at the charge of thoſe who continued,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:174108:88"/>conſtant, who were likewiſe prohibited to ſell or alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their Eſtates to ſupport themſelves, the King mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void all contracts of that kind; Yea to add to their misfortunes, they were forbid by divers Edicts under ſevere penalties not to go out of <hi>France</hi> to get their Bread in other Countrys, which reduced them to the horrible neceſſity of dying with hunger in their own Country.</p>
            <p>Their Cruelty ceaſed not here, for they laid unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſevere Taxes upon the Proteſtants, ſo that he who before was charged at Forty or Fifty Livers was now raiſed to ſeven or eight hundred, which if not inſtantly paid they quartered Dragoons upon them till they had diſcharged the utmoſt farthing. In 1681 an Edict came out that Children at ſeven years of age might abjure the Proteſtant Religion, forcing their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to give them yearly allowances above their ability, which occaſioned the ſeducing of many young people, and brought ruin to a multitude of Families, yea they took Children from their Parents and put them into Covents with ſtrict charge not to let their Fathers or Mothers ſee them, even Perſons of the beſt Quality were ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ren taken from him the eldeſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding twelve years, and the like was done to other Noblemen; a barbarity never heard of in the moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Nations. They prohibited the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be School-Maſters and ſuppreſſed three Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities which were abſolutely granted by the Edict of <hi>Nants.</hi> They forbid Papiſts to marry Proteſtants, or Miniſters to hinder their people directly or indirectly from imbracing the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; Theſe and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Grievances more they groaned under, when the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> being pleaſed to intercede on their Behalf, the King aſſured him, <hi>He was very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the behaviour of his Proteſtant Subjects, and that ſo long as he lived no wrong ſhould be done them;</hi> And yet at the ſame inſtant, according to the uſual perfidy of that party, he gave order for demoliſhing ſeveral of
<pb facs="tcp:174108:89"/>their Churches, and ſhut up others, impriſoning their Paſtors, and uſing divers manifeſt injuſtices againſt thoſe he pretended to protect.</p>
            <p>Yea in 1682. When they had much advanced the work of their deſtruction, the King declared, <hi>That he had not the leaſt intention to infringe the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>but would moſt religiouſly obſerve it;</hi> Though at the ſame time he had treacherouſly reſolved in Council to Ruin and Deſtroy it. And accordingly in 1684. He abſolutely concluded to cancel and make void that Edict, and to baniſh all their Miniſters out of the Kingdom, yet ſtill declaring, <hi>That other Proteſtants might live peaceably till it ſhould pleaſe God to enlighten and convert them;</hi> Which was only deſigned to inſnare and amuſe them at preſent, till they had by degrees incenſed the Mobile againſt them to diminiſh the horror they naturally have to Cruelty, to which end ſeveral young Prieſts were ſent about the Kingdom to inflame the multitude in their Sermons and Orations, and by publiſhing Scandalous Satyrs and Lyes againſt them; And for thoſe of greater Quality ſome Volumes were written againſt Calviniſm and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, one of whom affirmed highly, <hi>That the Catholick Faith muſt be planted by Fire and Sword, alledging for proof thereof, the example of a King of</hi> Norway, <hi>who converted the Nobles of his Countrey by threatning them, to ſlay their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before their eyes if they would not conſent to have them bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, and to be baptized themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proteſtants were very ſenſible of theſe things, and that further miſchief was deſigned againſt them, and therefore preſented frequent Addreſſes to the King, wherein they expoſed their grievances with all humility and ſubmiſſion, the laſt-being preſented to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by their Deputy General in <hi>March</hi> 1684. Expreſt in Terms moſt capable of moving pity, yet produced no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect but the haſtening what they had long before reſolved on, which was the uſing of open force to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their ruine, which was effectually done ſome months after in a manner ſo terrible and violent that there are few in Chriſtendom who have not heard the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:174108:89"/>report of it. At firſt they quartered Souldiers in all the Provinces almoſt at the ſame time, but chiefly Dragoons, the moſt deſperate Troops in the Kingdom; Terror and Dread marched before them, and all <hi>France</hi> was filled with the news; <hi>That the King would no longer ſuffer any Proteſtants in his Kingdom, and that they muſt reſolve to change their Religion, or elſe ſuffer the utmoſt cruelty that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them.</hi> They firſt ſummoned the Cities and Commonalties, and affembling the Inhabitants of the Reformed Religion, told them, <hi>It was the Kings pleaſure they ſhould without delay become Catholicks, and if they would not do it freely they muſt force them.</hi> The poor people ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the propoſal anſwered, <hi>They were ready to Sacrifice their Eſtates and Lives to the King, but their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences being Gods, they could not in the ſame manner diſpoſe of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such anſwers immediately brought the Dragoons who were near hand upon them, who inſtantly ſeized on all the Gates and Paſſages of the City, where they placed Guards who came off with their Swords in their hands crying, <hi>Kill, Kill, or elſe be Catholicks;</hi> They lay upon the Proteſtants at free quarter, ſtrictly forbidding any to go out of their Houſes, or to conceal any of their Goods or Eſtates under great penalties, &amp; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were fordid to receive or any way relieve them; the firſt days were ſpent in conſuming all the Proviſions the houſe afforded, and Robbing them of Money, Rings, Jewels or any thing of Value; After this they ſeized of all their goods in general, inviting the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to come and buy them; Laſtly they fell on their Perſons, wherein they forbore no wickedneſs nor Villany to oblige them to change their Religion.

They cut them with Penknives, and pluckt them by the Noſe with Red hot Pincers and dragged them about the Rooms till they promiſed to be Catholicks, or that for wearineſs they let the poor wretches go; They beat them with Staves and dragged them all bruiſed to the Churches, where their forced preſence was reckoned their abjuring the Proteſtant Religion. They kept them from ſleeping ſeven or eight nights and days together, relieving one another to keep them waking; They threw buckets of Water on their Faces, and tormented them ſeveral ways, by holding kettles over their Heads turned downwards, whereon they made a continual noiſe till theſe poor creatures had even loſt their ſences; If they found any ſick in bed they had the cruelty to bring ſeveral Drums ſounding an Alarm about their beds for whole weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without intermiſſion, till they had promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. In ſome places they tyed Fathers and Husbands to the bed-poſts, and raviſhed their Daughters and Wives on the bed before their eyes; In other places Rapes were publickly permitted for many hours together; They pluckt off the Nails from the hands and toes of others with moſt intolerable pain; They burnt the feet of others. They blew up men and women with bellows even till they were ready to burſt.</p>
            <p>If after theſe horrid Uſages any refuſed to turn, they impriſoned them in Cloſe, Dark and Stinking Dungeons, exerciſing on them all manner of inhumanity; In the mean time they demoliſhed their Houſes, deſtroyed their hereditary Lands, cut down their Woods, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:174108:90"/>ſeized their Wives and Children, to impriſon them in Monaſteries. When the Souldiers had conſumed and deſtroy'd all in the Houſe, the Tenants of their Lands furniſht them with ſubſiſtance, to whom they likewiſe ſold the Lands; If any endeavoured to eſcape by flight, they were purſued and hunted in the Fields and Woods, and Shot at like Wild Beaſts; The Juſtices and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates rode about the highways, ſtopping all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and uſing them like Priſoners of War; Neither fell this Storm only on the common ſort, Noblemen and Gentlemen were not exempted from it, who had Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers alſo quartered on them, that plundred their houſes waſted their Goods, razed their Caſtles, cut down their Woods, yea their very Perſons were expoſed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and barbarity of the Dragoons as well as others; which to avoid, many Ladies and Perſons of Quality hoped to find ſome retreat in <hi>Paris,</hi> or at the Court, not imagining the Dragoons would come to ſeek them ſo near the Kings preſence; but they ſoon found their miſtake, for immediately there was an Order of Council, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to leave <hi>Paris</hi> in fifteen days, and return without delay to their own dwellings, prohibiting all perſons to entertain or lodge them in their houſes; And ſome addroſſing to the King with complaints of ſuch cruel uſage, and beſeeching his relief, had no other anſwer but being ſent Priſoners to the Baſtile.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable that uſually in the head of theſe infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Dragoons there Marched a Squadron of Biſhops and Prieſts to ſee that the Souldiers executed the full Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance they deſired upon the Proteſtants, who upon all occaſions did provoke and ſtir up the Souldiers to cruelty and barbarity, if they found they had the leaſt compaſſion and pity toward theſe poor Innocents. If at any time the Maſter of an houſe had ſigned what they required, in hope to get rid of the Dragoons, yet he was not freed from them for all this, if his Wife Children or the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Servants did not do the ſame; and when any of them fled, they continued to torment the Maſter or Father till he forced them to come back, which being
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:174108:91"/>oft impoſſible for him to do, the change of his Religion did not at all avail him; When the poor Souls fancied they ſhould be at reſt by ſigning a form of abjuration of the Proteſtant Religion, yet a while after theſe cruel men made them ſign another, which threw many into the very depth of deſpair; Nay, after all theſe barbarous Uſages and Compulſions they forced theſe wretched peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to acknowledge, <hi>That they imbraced the Roman Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own accord, without being induced thereto by any violent means;</hi> Though all theſe Frauds, violences and cruelties, and infinite numbers more have been acted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Proteſtants in the face of the Sun, and before Millions of eye-witneſſes, and are notorious to all <hi>Europe;</hi> Yet this is another method that their Perſecutors have taken to ſhelter themſelves from publick condemnation, by denying the Fact, and perſwading the World, <hi>That force and violence have had no ſhare in the Converſions, but that they were Soft, Calm, and Voluntary, and that if there were any Dragoons concerned therein, it was becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants themſelves deſired them that they might have a handſom pretence to change their Religion;</hi> Was there ever ſo much impudence ſeen or heard of, what will they not deny who are arrived to ſuch a height of boldneſs?</p>

            <p>The very day this was publiſhed in <hi>Paris</hi> they began to demoliſh the Church of <hi>Charenton,</hi> and the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was commanded to leave the City in twenty four hours &amp; the reſt in fifteen days, but were neither permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to diſpoſe of their Eſtates, nor to carry any of their effects with them, nor to take along with them Father, Mother, Brother, Siſter, or any of their kindred, though many were infirm, decayed, &amp; poor, and could not ſubſiſt but by their means, yea they denied them their own Children if above ſeven years old, nay ſome they took from them under that age; yea thoſe that hanged on their Mothers breaſts, refuſing to allow Nurſes for their new born Infants to whom the Mothers could not give ſuck.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the former barbarities, or greater, if poſſible, were revived, of which I ſhall give ſome few inſtances amongſt many others, and ſo conclude this diſmal ſcene of ſorrow. The Dragoons that quartered with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Solignac</hi> at <hi>Montauban</hi> made his dining room a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their Horſes, though the furniture thereof was valued at a thouſand Livers and forced him to turn the Spit till his arm was almoſt burnt by their continual throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wood on the fire; They beat an old man almoſt to death, to force him to go to Maſs, whilſt the conſtant Martyr to his laſt breath cryed, <hi>He would never do it,</hi> and only requeſted they would diſpatch and make an end of him. <hi>Monſieur de Garriſon</hi> one of the chief men of the City, and an intimate Friend of the Intendant, went and caſt himſelf at his feet, imploring his protection, and conjuring him to rid him of the Troopers, that he might
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:174108:92"/>have no force put upon his Conſcience, adding, <hi>That in recompence of the favour he begged of him, he would give him all he had,</hi> which was to the value of about a Million of Livres, but all his intreaties were ſo far from prevailing, that he ordered him for terror to be worſe uſed than the reſt, by dragging him along the Streets.</p>
            <p>Some of the luſtieſt Souldiers took their Land-lords or others in the houſe, and walking them up and down, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually tickled, and toſſed them about like a ball from each other, without giving them the leaſt intermiſſion, and keeping them in that condition three days together, without Meat, Drink, or Sleep; When they were ſo faint as not able to ſtand any longer on their Legs, they laid them on a bed continuing to tickle and torment them as before, and when a little recovered, forced them to riſe again, laſhing them with Rods, to prevent their ſleeping; When one party of theſe curſed Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors were tyred and wearied out, their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions relieved them, by which infernal invention many became diſtracted and mopiſh, and ſo continue; <hi>Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Wife of one <hi>Rouſſion</hi> a Joiner, being violently drag'd by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers along the Streets to force her to hear Maſs, died of this cruel and inhumane treatment as ſoon as ſhe reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church Porch.

            <p>In divers places they have indeavoured to tire out the Patience of the poor Proteſtants, and overcome their conſtancy by applying red hot Irons to the hands and feet of men, and to the Breaſts of Women; At <hi>Nants</hi> they hung up ſeveral Women and Maids by the feet, ſtark naked, and others by the armpits, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

            <p>A young woman was brought before the Council in order to oblige her to abjure the Truth, which ſhe boldly and manfully refuſing was remanded back to Priſon, where they ſhaved her head, and ſinged the hair from other parts, and ſtripping her ſtark naked led her through the Streets of the City, where many a blow was given her, and Stones flung at her; After this they ſet her up to the neck in a Tub full of Water, where when ſhe had been a while they took her out, and put upon her a Shift dipped in Wine, which as it dryed and Stuck to her ſore and bruiſed body, they ſnatcht off again, and then had another ready dipt in Wine to clap upon her;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:174108:93"/>this they repeated ſix ſeveral times, and when by this inhumane uſage her body was grown very raw, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they demanded of her, <hi>Whether ſhe did not now find her ſelf diſpoſed to imbrace the Catholick Faith?</hi> As they term their Religion; But ſhe being ſtrengthned by the Spirit &amp; love of him for whoſe names ſake ſhe ſuffered all theſe extremities, undauntedly anſwered; <hi>That ſhe had before declared her reſolution to them, which ſhe would never alter; and that though they had her body in their power, yet ſhe was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never to yield her Soul to them, but keep it pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed for her heavenly Lover, as knowing that a little while would put an end to all her ſufferings, and give a beginning to her enjoyment of eternal bliſs.</hi> Which words further inraging them, and deſpairing of making her a Convert, they faſtened her to a Gibbet by the feet ſtark naked, with her head downward, and there let her hang in that ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious poſture till ſhe gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>There was an old man in the City who having been long kept Priſoner in a deep dungeon for the Proteſtant Profeſſion, where his companions were darkneſs and horror, and filthy creeping things, was brought at length before the Judges with Vermine and Snails crawling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mouldred garment, who ſeeing him in that loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom condition, ſaid to him, <hi>How now, old man, does not not your heart begin to relent, and are not you willing to abjure your Hereſy?</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>As for Hereſy I profeſs none, but if by that word you mean my Religion, you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine yourſelves that as I have thus long lived, ſo I hope &amp; am reſolved by the grace of God to dye in it.</hi> With which reply they being incenſed, grew rougher with him; <hi>Doſt thou not ſee, ſaid they, that the worms are ready to devour thee?

Some Dragoons quartered with a Perſon whom they could not pervert
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:174108:94"/>who upon a time being well filled with Wine, broke their Glaſſes at every health they drank, and covered the floor with the fragments, and being in a merry humor would needs go dance, telling their Hoſt he muſt be one of their company, but that he muſt firſt pull off his Stockings and Shoes, to move the more nimbly; in ſhort they forced him to dance barefoot upon the ſharp points of Glaſs, which when they had continued ſo long as they were able to keep him on his Legs, they laid him on a Bed, and ſtripping him ſtark naked, rolled his body from one end of the Room to the other upon the ſharp Glaſs till his Skin was ſtuck full of the fragments, and returning him to his bed ſent for a Surgeon to take out all the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Glaſs out of his body which was not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequent inciſions and horrible and extream, pain.

            <p>Mean time the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cantons of <hi>Switzerland</hi> being informed of this Order, thought they ought not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a People Perſecuted for their Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent Ambaſſadors to the Duke, to know the reaſon thereof, who returned no other anſwer but, <hi>That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements wherein he had entred with</hi> France <hi>oppoſed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their Negotiation, whereby he had obliged himſelf to extirpate all the Proteſtants out of his Countrey;</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> fortified themſelves the beſt they could to prevent the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>French</hi> Troops, yet afterward the Duke publiſhed an Order that if they would voluntarily depart they ſhould carry away what goods they pleaſed, but without fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms; But the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> having had ſuch woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Treachery, and being ſatisfied that this Edict was nothing but a ſnare to intangle them, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to accept of it, and ſent the <hi>Switzer</hi> Ambaſſadors, by whoſe mediation this Edict was procured, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in the matter, who uſed all imaginable diligence to procure them more certain and advantagious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but were told <hi>That as long as the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>were in Arms they could agree to nothing;</hi> and the Proteſtants being perſwaded that they would not diſarm them, but that they might the eaſier deſtroy them without trouble or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, would by no means yield to it, but reſolved to defend themſelves if they came to attack them.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> came into his Camp ſome days after the Edict, to ſtrike terror into the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> by his preſence, and joining his Troops with thoſe of <hi>France</hi> he reſolved to attack the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <hi>April</hi> 22. 1686 was the day appointed; The <hi>French</hi> Army commanded. by <hi>Cativat</hi> Governour of <hi>Caſal</hi> marched two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, by torch light to ingage them, but found ſuchs ſtout reſiſtance that they loſt above 500 of their men,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:174108:96"/>with ſeveral Officers of Note, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> having only two men killed; but at length the force of the Enemy was ſo much increaſed that the Proteſtants not being able to make reſiſtance, yielded to lay down their arms and depart the Countrey according to the Edict, ſince no time was prefixt, but the <hi>French</hi> heated with their loſs, maſſacred them without diſtinction of Age or Sex, putting all to the Sword that fell into their hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to Women or Children; yea old and ſick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had the ſame treatment.</p>
            <p>In another part of the Countrey the Duke himſelf having burnt all the houſes in his way, came to ſtorm a Fort of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> who received him ſo warmly with their Muskets and Stones that they killed the Enemy 300 men, and loſt only five; but being at length over-powered with number, and hearing the <hi>French</hi> were coming to aſſiſt the Duke, they treated with <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> the Dukes Uncle, who promiſed poſitively on his part and their own, that they ſhould be abſolutely pardoned if they would yield themſelves to his elemency; But the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> making ſome difficulty to confide in this promiſe, <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> ſent them a note written with his own hand in the name of the Duke to this effect; <hi>Lay down your arms immediately and ſubmit your ſelves to his Royal Highneſſes clemency; in ſo doing aſſure your ſelves that he will pardon you, and that your Perſons and thoſe of your Wives and Children ſhall not be touched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which aſſurance, when the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> laid down their Arms, relying on this promiſe, yet all that yielded were made Priſoners, and carried to the City of <hi>Lucerne</hi> under pretence of being led to make their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to the Duke. And a multitude of others who yielded upon the like deceitful promiſes, had their lives taken away, and above twelve Thouſand taken Priſoners. After this manner the light of the Goſpel hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in a Countrey where it hath ſhone ſo bright for ſo many ages; the perfidiouſneſs and treachery of the Inquiſitors having triumpht over the true Faith to the extirpation thereof; But for diſcovering what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:174108:96"/>their Perſecutors were of, we will conclude with a few inſtances of the horrid outrages and Cruelties they have committed on theſe occaſions. The <hi>French</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers entring the Valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> maſſacred many old Men, Women and little Children, and raviſhed the young Women and Maidens, whom they afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to march ſtark naked at the head of their Army, to ſerve for Guides; yea they were ſo monſtrouſly dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical as to ſatiate their infamous luſts on the bodies of thoſe they had ſlain. They would have defloured <hi>Margaret Marande</hi> not fourteen years old, and becauſe her Parents made ſome oppoſition they inhumanely butchered them; Two others they ſlew for refuſing to comply with their Villany. They put an old man into an houſe and burnt him in it; Four Women and three Children were murthered in a Cave where they had hid themſelves; An ancient woman of fourſcore they tumbled down a Rock, for not going faſt enough. A great number of Women and Virgins ſtriving to ſecure themſelves in the Woods, were diſpatcht with Muskets; The ways were ſtrewed with the dead bodies of little Children cut to pieces, and naked Women Maſſacred with Swords; In the valley of St. <hi>Martin</hi> ſix men, twenty Women and ſome Children ſurrendred themſelves to the enemy upon promiſe of ſafety, but the men were inſtantly ſhot to death in the preſence of their Wives; Some they tyed to horſes tails, &amp; dragged them along till they expired. They hung up a blind old woman before her own houſe.</p>

            <p>In fine, all the Heatheniſh and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Barbarities of former Ages were revived and acted over again upon theſe bleſſed Martyrs, that it is ſcarce poſſible to believe thoſe who bear the name of Chriſtians ſhould be ſo inhumane, whereby above Eight Thouſand Perſons have expired, and a multitude more, even all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of thoſe once flouriſhing Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> driven into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, though kindly received by the <hi>Switzers</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>Gods Judgments upon Popiſh Perſecutors, diſcovered in ſome eminent Examples.</head>
            <p n="1">1. FRom the Firſt plantation of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in this Nation under King <hi>Lucius,</hi> there was never any King or Queen of <hi>England</hi> in whoſe Reign ſo much Chriſtian blood was ſpilt, as in four years ſpace during the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> But as ſhe was prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of the Lives of the beſt of her Subjects, and a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Goſpel, ſo it pleaſed God to follow her with Plagues and Judgments all her life; for nothing proſpered which ſhe took in hand; of which we ſhall give ſome few Inſtances. The faireſt and greateſt Ship ſhe had, called the <hi>Great Harry,</hi> was burnt by Lightning from Heaven, the Chriſtian World at that time not affording ſuch another. Then ſhe would needs marry <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> thereby Subjecting <hi>England</hi> to Strangers, yet with her utmoſt endeavour, ſhe could never ſet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown on his head. Then did ſhe attempt the Reſtitution of Abby Lands, and had all the aſſiſtance that the Pope could give her therein, yet ſhe was utterly croſt alſo in that Deſign. Then ſhe loſt <hi>Calice</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which had been in the poſſeſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> during the Reign of eleven Kings, that is, from the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third; with which loſs ſhe was ſo afflicted, that ſhe told ſome of her Courtiers, <hi>If they opened her body when ſhe was dead, they would find</hi> Calice <hi>written in her heart.</hi> She was reported to be with Child, but it came to nothing. Her beloved Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band left her, in whom ſhe placed her greateſt felicity and content. So that now ſhe could neither enjoy him, nor marry another. About the ſame time the Land was grievouſly afflicted with horrible Tempeſts, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Plagues, mortal Diſeaſes and burning Agues, ſo that between <hi>October</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> there died ſeven Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:174108:98"/>in <hi>London</hi> that had been Lord Mayors; and the mortality was ſo great, that much Corn was loſt in the Fields, for want of men to gather it; whereby great ſcarcity enſued, and many poor people lived upon Accorns. And laſtly, ſhe was ſtruck with a lingring and pining ſickneſs, whereof ſhe died; having only reigned Five years and Five month<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. In the next place, let us conſider Gods Judgments upon ſome other Inſtruments of Cruelty; and among the reſt, <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> who was a moſt Cruel Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Proteſtants; In King <hi>Heary the Eighths</hi> time he was a great ſtickler for the divorce from the <hi>Lally Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was therefore made Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> In King <hi>Edward the ſixths</hi> time he ſeemed a Friend to the Goſpel, and preached it up; but in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days he was the greateſt and moſt inveterate enemy againſt it, and the profeſſor thereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo to his dying day; For the ſame day that Biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> were burnt at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the old Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> came to dine with <hi>Gardiner:</hi> The Biſhop deferred his Dinner till about four a Clock in the Afternoon, at which time came one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants poſting to tell him, that fire was put to theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God; which when he was certified of, he came out rejoyeing to the Duke, and ſaid, <hi>Now let us go to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> The Table was preſently ſet, and the Biſhop began to eat merrily, but as ſoon as he had earen a few bits, he was on a ſudden ſtruck very ſick, and being carried from the Table to Bed, he there continued in ſuch into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Anguiſh and Torment, that he could void no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either by Stool or Urine. His Tongue was black and ſwoln ſo big that his mouth could not contain it, and his body violently Inflamed. In this ſad condition he lay fifteen days, and then ended his miſerable life. In the beginning of his ſickneſs, Dr. <hi>Day</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> coming to ſee him, began to ſpeak to him about the merciful Promiſes of God, and free Juſtification by the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:174108:98"/>blood of Chriſt. To whom he anſwered, <hi>What, my Lord, will you open that gap now? then farewell all together; Open this window to the People, and farewell all together;</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by another Perſon put in mine of St. <hi>Peters</hi> denying his Maſter, and that he ought not to deſpair; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I have denied Chriſt with <hi>Peter,</hi> but I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented with <hi>Peter.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. Dr. <hi>Whittington</hi> Chancellor, having condemned a Godly Religious woman to be Burnt at <hi>Chipping Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> a multitude of People came to ſee her Suffer, and among the reſt <hi>Whittington</hi> himſelf. At the ſame time there was a Butcher in another place of the Town, killing a Bull, who was faſt bound with a Rope ready to be knockt on the head; the Butcher miſſing his ſtroke, the Bull broke looſe juſt as the people were coming from the Execution of this Holy Martyr; the people ſeeing him coming ſevered themſelves, and made a Lane for him; the Bull paſſed through them without hurting man, woman or child, till he came to the place where <hi>Whittington</hi> was, againſt whom he ran very furiouſly, and thruſting his Horns into his belly, ran him quite through; and tearing out his Guts with his horns, he trail'd them about the ſtreets, to the great aſtoniſhment of thoſe that ſaw his wretched end.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

Shortly after, this <hi>Burton</hi> and a neighbour riding together, a Crow flew over his head, and voided her Excrements upon his Noſe, which ran down his beard, and yielded ſuch an horrible ſtink, that it cauſed him to vomit in a moſt violent manner, whereupon he got home to bed, but could eat nothing, the ſtink and vomiting ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, which made him with dreadful Oaths and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations curſe the Crow that had poiſoned him, and ſo he continued in extream pain till he died.</p>

            <p n="7">7. One <hi>James Abbes</hi> was burned for a Martyr; and as he went toward the Stake, ſome poor People met him, begging Alms from him; and becauſe he had no money, he plucked off his Cloaths, even to his ſhirt, and diſtributed them among them, and withal earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, <hi>To be ſtrong in the Lord, and as faithful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the Truth of the Goſpel, which with Gods aſſiſtance</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I will now in your ſight ſeal with my Blood.</hi> But whilſt he was thus ſpeaking, one of the Sheriffs men who ſtood by, and heard him, cryed out and exclaimed aloud againſt him to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying, <hi>Good People believe him not, he is an Heretick, and a mad man, and out of his wits, believe him not, for it is Hereſie which he ſpeaketh;</hi> And as Mr. <hi>Abbes</hi> continued his Exhortation, this wretch conſtantly exclaimed againſt him all the way as he went to the ſtake, at which this Faithful Martyr was burned. But as ſoon as the Fire was kindled, the fearful ſtroke of Gods Juſtice fell upon this wretch, who immediately before all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fell mad and diſtracted, wherewith he had a while before charged that bleſſed Servant of Chriſt; and in a
